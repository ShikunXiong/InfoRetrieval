sonnet

BY henri teono sea chaplain IN the reign OF charl

compos octob first east part candia

O ginne boni lass
which mak world woonder
how ever com pass
that wee part sunder

the driven snow rose rare
the gloriou sunn thee
can ginne compar
she wonder love

her merri look forhead high
her hayr like goldenwy
her hand foot lipe eye
would set saint fyre

and give giune due
ther ill part
the turtledov half true
then whoe live without

king solomon ere lay
did nere unbrac kinder
O ginne gang away
and left behind

then search place room
from london virginni
from doverpeer scanderoon
but find ginni

but ginni turn back fear
when mind
then back england stear
To see find

and have ginne again
If sheed doe indeavour
the world shall never make us twain
weel live dye togeth



song BY king charl

on duchess portsmouth leav england

for mirror

bright morn cool air
seren sky
when wave left dear
the center joy
heav n natur smile
and noth sad

each rosi field odour spread
all fragrant shore
each river god rose bed
and sigh d pow r
curl wave deck d head
As proud bore

glide ye wave bear line
and tell distress
bear sigh ye gentl wind
and waft breast
tell eer prove unkind
never shall rest
