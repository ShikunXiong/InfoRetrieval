written after violent thunderstorm IN the countri

An hour agon prostrat natur lay
like soresmitten creatur nigh death
with feverish pallid lip labor breath
and languid eyebal darken day
burn noontid rule merciless sway
earth wave air ghastlystretch heath
the sullen tree faint flower beneath
droop hopeless shrivel torrid ray
when sudden like cheer trumpet blown
far rescu spirit rose wind
urg great host cloud thunder tone
