and blude ran doun like rain

To sall yield quoth erl perci

nor yet shalt thou yield
but thou shalt yield bracken bush
that grow yon lily lea

As soon knew montgomeri

they shot dead ninestan rig
besid headless cross
and left lie blood
upon moor moss

they made bier broken bough
the sauch aspin grey
and bore ladi chapel
and wake day

ladi came lone bower
and threw robe asid
she tore ling lang yellow hair
and knelt barthram side

she bath ladywel
hi wound sae deep sair
and plait garland breast
and garland hair

they row lili sheet
and bare earth
and grey friar sung dead man mass
As pass chapel garth

they buri mirk midnight
when dew fell cold still
when aspin grey forgot play
and mist clung hill

they dug grave bare foot deep
By edg ninestan burn
and cover oer heatherflow
the moss ladyfern

grey friar staid upon grave
and sang till morn tide
and friar shall sing barthram soul
while headless cross shall bide

and night lay deep silenc sea

Of peril farn wild wave ever

sound far strife starhaunt gloam

befor loom night
darker night sad heart
king ida castl sheer crag set
wake darker sorrow yet
within light
beauti might old love rent apart
timebroken spent
and strewn old dead wind among saltsea bent

till dream glitter day
and eve beauti star
time fell nightcloud withdrawn
and enchant dawn
all golden haze
saw gleam tower joyou gard
In splendour rise
tall pinnacl white dreamladen eye

while thither day old
launcelot homeward came
warweari yet wearier strife
Of love tore life

and thither great love brought
the fugit love

one day twixt dark dark
these lover fate caught
In love bright web dream blue sky
Of love tide
Of waver life may part death swift sea divid

but launcelot bliss forlorn
fled laughter clear
Of happi lover love silent noon
all night beneath moon
He strode spirit torn
for guenever all night guenever
He cri aloud

then fade quiver sight

the tower joyou gard shall never

No long r night
wrestl love beneath pale moon gleam
