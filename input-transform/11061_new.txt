My youth past morn stand
with manhood signet command
firmplant life middleland

behind scene reced afar
where cloudi mist vapor mar
the lustr morningstar

mark cours day
inwound mani doubt maze
To marvel deviou way

they lead hill level lone
green field woodland overgrown
and deep water puls moan

By ruin tower darksom dell
the home nightbird fierc fell
wherein strang shape horror dwell

out bless sunshin free
the breezi moor liberti
and sky outpour harmoni

By palacewal haunt tomb
through bright dark joy gloom
My life hath known blight bloom

and mountainheight
backward strain eager sight
till landscap melt night

then whisper heart Be bold
turn year whose tale told
To greet futur dawn gold

high hope nobler labor wait
beyond futur open gate
brave deed hold seed fate

thi strength O lord shall fire blood
shall nerv soul make wise mood
and win pure good

Or O father thou shouldst say
dark angel close mortal day
and smite vanward way

grant armor firm strong
whilst peal still life battlesong
and struggl man gainst wrong

thi soldier would fight win
No crown dross bay sin
may fall amidst foremost din

Of truth grand conflict blest thee
and even though death conquer see
how fals brief victori
