No care oppress heart

verses

what must must littl one
the dark night follow day
and eb tide seaward glide
across moonlit bay

what must must littl one
the winter follow fall
and pri wind entranc find
through chink cottag wall

what must must littl one
the brown hair turn gray
and soul like light earli night
slip gentli far away

A littl parable

just beyond toil town
saw child today
with busi littl hand brown
make toy clay

work heart
beneath spread tree
He mould unconsci art
whatev seem pleas

men fortress plate pie
all clay made
then rub chubbi fist eye
and slumber shade

when morn breaks

when morn break fortun wait
what ship shall rise misti sea
what friend shall clasp hand fond farewel
what dreamwrought castl night cloud dispel
shall rais sunkiss tower upon lea

tonight moonqueen shine wide free
tonight sigh breez song thee
but time brief what cometh tell
when morn break

tonight tonight happi let us
tonight tonight life shadowi care shall flee
and though dawn come chime knell
when night recal last bright sentinel

A lost memory

listen twilight long ago
To sweet voic sing soft low

wa song ballad ladi fair
save deadli peril bold corsair

Or song battl fli foe
nay forgotten t long ago

scarc half rememb half forgot
tell song

memori unfaith kept strain
heard twilight never heard

everi day bring twilight twilight bring
To ear music quiet wing

after autumn sunset dream light
when long summer even deepen night

all sure long ago
some one sang twilight sweet low

the truthseekers

they sought truth sinc dawn
and sought vain

come slow step face drawn
with nameless pain
To meet night halfway

Of sight
had faintest trace
nay ye sought

To see place
and never make rueful face
At housework like women

It take grist care waitin
To tend her but m astatin
but jest fact say
there never singl day
that gal left mother side
except meetin ride
through mud mire rain snow
To market could nt go

she thirtyf ye
than she mighti nigh twoscor
but odd she sweet mild
To mother child

our eldest darter lizi ann

had offer wal reckon though
she neer told mother
mind one chap like man
who seem clean gone lizi ann
and yet let feller slide
and senc found anoth bride

the rose cheek gone
and left em kinder pale wan
her mate marri dead stray
To place youth maid
No longer come see yet
you ll hear murmur regret
My life part heaven plan
