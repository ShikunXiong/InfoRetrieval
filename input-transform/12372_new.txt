the stori OF karin

danish legend


karin fair karin gay
she came morn bridal day

she came millpond clear bright
and view hersel morn light

and oh cri bonni brow
may ever white smooth

and oh hair love braid
Be yellow sunshin brown shade

and oh waist sae slender fine
may never need girdl longer mine

she linger laugh oer water clear
when sudden start shriek fear

Oh face sae laidli old
that look side water cold

she turn around view bank
and osier willow dark dank

and fern see aris
An age crone wi awsom eye

Ha ha laugh ye re bonni bride
see ye ll fare gin new year tide

Ye ll wear robe sae blith gran
An elllong girdl canna span

when twalmonth three shall pass away
your berrybrown hair shall streak wi gray

and gin ye mither bairni nine
your brow shall wrinkl dark mine

karin sprang feet wi speed
and clap hand abun head

pray saint spirit
that never child may mither call

the crone drew near crone spake
nine time flesh bane shall ach

laidli awsom ye shall wane
Wi toil care travailpain

better said karin lay low
and sink aye water flow

the crone rais wither hand high
and show tree stood hard

and take bonni fruit said
and eat till seed dark red

count less count
nine time shall number oer

and number shall speak
cast seed seed lake

karin ate fruit sae fine
T mellow sand sweet brine

seed seed let fall
the water rippl

but ilka seed karin threw
upros bubbl view

upros sigh lake
As though babi heart break



twice nine year come gone
karin fair walk lone

she see around ilka side
maiden mither wife bride

wan pale bonni brow
sunken sad eyelid

slow step heavi breast
and never arm whereon rest

the old kirkporch karin spi
the posterndoor open wide

wae said ll enter
and shrive everi sin

T silenc within kirk
the aisl empti chill mirk

the chancelrail black bare
nae priest nae penit

karin knelt prayer said
but heart within heavi dead

her prayer fell back cold gray stone
It would rise heaven alon

darker grew darksom aisl
colder felt heart

wae cri sin
never wrong kith kin

but start quak wi fear
lest dread doom hear

and light seem fall
On sixth command upon wall

and see aris
and look wi stoni eye

shadowi troop flock sae fast
the kirkyard may hold last

young old ilk degre
bairn bairni bairn see

all look either way
mother mother seem say

we soul might
but vaniti sin

we number multipli
might live love die

might serv lord
might met thi soul bliss

mourn us pray
who might never may

thu voic die away
might never may

karin left kirk
never pass posterndoor

they found dead vesper toll
may heaven merci rest soul

what WE all think

that age older
In spite lock untim shed
Or silver youth brow
that babe make love children wed

that sunshin heavenli glow
which fade good old day
when winter came deeper snow
and autumn softer haze

that mother sister wife child
the best women known
were schoolboy ever half wild
how young grandpapa grown

that but this soul free
and but that live blest
that season yet
our care leav us time rest

whene groan ach pain
some common ailment race
though doctor think matter plain
that peculiar case

that like babe finger burn
We count one bitter maxim
our lesson world learn
and men wiser

that sob oer fanci woe
the angel hover overhead
count everi piti drop flow
and love us tear shed

that stand tearless eye
and turn beggar door
they still approv us sigh
Ah one thousand more

that weak smooth path sin
In half slip youth known
and whatsoe blame
that merci flower fault outgrown

though templ crowd crumbl brink
oerhang truth etern flow
their tablet bold what think
their echo dumb what know

that one unquest text read
all doubt beyond fear
nor crackl pile curs creed
can burn blot god love

Of limitless realm air

Of citi celesti wait

chant one hymn expir
with song irresist stress

As harpstr broken asund
By music throb express

but seren raptur throng
unmov rush song
with eye unimpass slow
among dead angel deathless
sandalphon stand listen breathless
To sound ascend

from spirit earth ador
from soul entreat implor
In frenzi passion prayer
from heart broken loss
and weari drag cross
too heavi mortal bear

and gather prayer stand
and chang flower hand
into garland purpl red
and beneath great arch portal

Of ancient rabbin lore

Of hunger thirst heart
