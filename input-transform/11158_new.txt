AT syracus


all day mule patient tread
had move along plain
now oer lava ashen bed
now sprout grain
across torrent rocki lair
beneath aloehedg
where yellow broom make sweet air
and wave purpl sedg

lone hill save supin
the doze goatherd lay
Or rude broken shrine
the peasant knelt pray
Or athwart distant blue
thin saffron cloud ascend
As carbonari hid view
their smoulder ember tend

luxuri vale steril reach
mountain templecrown
Or inland curv glisten beach
the chang scene surround
while scarlet poppi burn near
and citron emerald gleam
make barren interv appear
dim laps dream

how meekli oer meadow gay
the azur flaxbloom spread
what fragranc breez may
the almondblossom shed
widebranch figtre deck field
Or round quarri cling
and cactusstalk thorni shield
In wild contort spring

here grove cork dusk shadow throw
there vineleav lightsom sway
while chestnutplum seren glow
abov oliv gray
tall pine upon slope mead
their sylvan dome uprear
and rankli papyrusre
low cluster mere

and syracus pensiv mien
In solitari pride
like untam throneless queen
crouch lucent tide
with honey thyme still hybla teem
it scent zephyr bore
and arethusa fountain gleam
pellucid yore

methought upstart bath
old archimed cri
eureka silent path
whose echo long repli
that pythia sunsetglow
rush damon arm
while tyrant cave
moan impot alarm

and upon sculptur stone
the ruin arch besid
hoari bronz wrinkl crone
the twirl distaff pli
love exalt reason fraught
In plato accent came
and truth paul sublim taught
relum virgin flame

the ancient sepulchr rose
along voiceless street
time myriad vista seem close
and bid life wave retreat
As intrus footstep stole
beyond mortal sphere
and felt awe eager soul
immort comrad near

the mossgrown rampart loom sight
like warder deep
where flush even amber light
the haven water sleep
unfurrow roman keel
Or carthaginian oar
the spear burnish galley
their slumber break

but distant conventbel
ere day last smile depart
with mellow cadenc plead fell
upon brood heart
and memori phantom thick fast
their fond illus bred
from peerless spirit past
and wreck age fled

joy broke spell emblem blest
that lone harbor cheer
As greet pilgrim guest
My countri flag appear
it radiant fold auror stream
amid haunt air
and everi star prophet beam
with freedom triumph
