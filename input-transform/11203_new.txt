curiou account wreck ship coast new holland

Il sembl que je ne doi pa omettr ici une histoir de la
certitud de laquel neut pa lieu de douter desqu la nouvel
fut venu batavia anno que le vaisseau le dragon qui venoit de
holland aux ind avoit fait naufrag sur le cote dune terr
austral inconnu envoia la flute la bouee la veill pour
ramen ceux de gen de lequipag qui auroient pu se sauver et le
efet qui auroient ete conservez

La flute etant conduit par ceux qui etoient echapez du naufrag dan la
chaloup et venu batavia en aport la nouvel se rendit au parag
ou le dragon avoit peri et alla mouiller lancr dan lendroit qui
parut le plu propr pour son dessein aussi tot la chaloup fut arme
pour aller chercher ceux qui setoient sauvez le long du rivag ell
saprocha dabord du bri pardessu lequel le vagu passoient pui
ell nagea ver le lieu ou lon avoit dress de tent quand la
chaloup du vaisseau peri partit pour ceux quel navoit pu recevoir
et qui devoient attendr la quon vint le prendr

lequipag etant descendu terr trouva le tent brise en piec
et lon ne decouvrit pa un seul homm dan tout le pai La surpris ne
fut pa mediocr On regarda partout si lon ne verroit point de trace
qui marquass quon eut construit quelqu petit batiment mai il n
avoit ni tarrier ni hach ni couteaux ni cloux etc Il n avoit ni
ecrit ni indic par ou lon put conjectur ce quetoi devenu le
gen quon avoit la laissez

La chaloup etant retourne bord et aiant annonc cett nouvel il
fut resolu que lon iroit chercher plu avant dan le terr et le long
du rivag pour cet efet se divisa en plusieur troup et lon ne
reussit pa mieux que la premier foi On eut beau crier apel tirer
de coup de mousquet tout fut inutil et je nai pa seu quon ait
jamai apri ce quetoi devenu ce gensla

On retourna donc au bri dont ne put rien tirer le lame aiant
emport le bordag le ecoutil et fracass tout le vaisseau tant
la mer brise fort en ce parag ainsi lon jugea que le plu expedi
etoit de sen retourn puisquon navoit rien pretendr et quon
avoit craindr le vent forcez et le tempet qui selon le
apar auroient aussi fait perir la flute dan ce dessein alla
fair de leau ceux qui furent une petit rivier quon avoit vue
aulieu de se hater se promener et courur en diver endroit

cepend il seleva une si terribl tempet que la flute fut
contraint de se mettr au larg ou ell atendit encor quelqu tem
mai comm la chaloup ne revenoit point jugea quel avoit peri
sibien quon reprit la rout de batavia ou lon fit le raport de ce qui
setoit pass

quand lorag eut cess lequipag de la chaloup se rembarqua pour
retourn bord mai il ne trouva plu la flute ni sur la cote ni au
larg La tristess ne fut pa moindr que letonn et lon ne seut
quel parti prendr enfin il fallut retourn terr pour netr pa
englouti par le flot mai navoit point de vivr et lon ne
voioit rien dan tout le pai qui put servir de nouritur le montagn
netoient que de rocher le vale etoient de vrai desert le
plain netoient que de sabl Le rivag etoit aussi bord de roch
contr lesquel la mer brisoit avec defroiabl mugissemen

ceux qui etoient la demeurez se trouvoient au nombr de treiz homm
qui furent bientot fatiguez afoibl et attenuez La faim le pressoit
le froid et lhumidit le faisoient soufrir et il se regardoi comm
condamnez la mort Il n avoit rien esper du bri le vagu
avoient tout fait rouler ca et la dan la mer enfin forc de courir et
de chercher quelqu chose quil pussent manger il apercur entr le
rocher qui etoient le long du rivag de gro limacon et de plu
petit qui venoient de la mer et dont le gout qui etoit passabl
parut excel de gen affamez mai naiant point de feu pour le
fair cuir lusag continuel quil en firent commenca de le
incommod et il sentir bien que ce foibl remed ne le empecheroit
pa de mourir dan peu de tem

enfin ne voiant de tout part quun mort certain il prirent la
resolut de sexpos la merci de flot dan lesper que sil
ne se presentoit rien de plu favor pour eux sur la mer que sur la
terr au moin la mort quil trouveroi seroit plu promt et le
delivreroit plutot de leur miser cepend il se flatoient encor de
lesper de pouvoir abord en quelqu autr pai ou il auroit de
chose propr pour la nourritur de homm

ainsi chacun travailla selon se forc calfat la chaloup fair
provis de limacon remplir de futail deau apr cela lon mit
le batiment la mer et lon quitta ce lieu ou lon navoit vu que de
desert arid et de feux folet et ou il n avoit ni bete ni gen
On perdit bientot de vue ce pai steril le second pilot de la flute
etant parmi cett troup desole et la guidant par le cour du soleil
de la lune et de etoil

cepend il avoient troi quatr cent lieue de chemin fair
pour terrir la cote septentrional de la grand java On peut assez
simagin quell soufranc il furent exposez dan un tel batiment
pendent une tell rout et avec sipeu de vivr et simauvai par le
beau tem il voguoient encor passabl mai quand la mer etoit
gross le lame le couvroient et passoient pardessu leur tete et
la chaloup etoit toujour sur le point de se voir submerge

mai la plu cruell avantur fut que le limacon se corrompir et
il n eut plu moien den manger sibien que pour tout aliment il ne
resta que de leau La nuit il faisoit un froid insuport et le jour
etoit brule de ardeur du soleil tout esper de salut sembloit
etr retranche et le fatigu aussibien que le manqu de nourritur
avoient entier epuis le forc de ce infortun lorsquun matin
il decouvrir le montagn meridional de la grand java
