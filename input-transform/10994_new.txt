youth temptat

mani snare temptat young friend
will often obtrud way
and constantli everi footstep attend
and threaten lead astray

perhap ll tempt hazard lie
some trivial fault conceal
but rememb god allse nigh
and one day falsehood reveal

you ll tempt cheat companion play
for sake marbl top
but enter dishonesti way
will find easi stop

you ll tempt perhap holi friend despis
and follow godless vain
but ever rememb walk wise
If heaven seek attain

anoth temptat lie road
To think religion sad
but none happi love god
and none dull bad

bewar slight day lord
and never duti neglect
but meet peopl revrenc word
If would bless expect

but though temptat path attend
the lord still make care
will seek guid friend
mid everi temptat snare



heaven

far beyond furthest sky
never seen mortal eye
heaven dazzl beauti lie
An unfad paradis

even dim gloomi night
never veil world light
winter never sojourn
summer reign throughout year

In one bright uncloud day
endless age roll away
there beneath unset sun
year ceaseless pleasur run

there good concord sweet
worship jehovah feet
rais song joy unknown
circl round holi throne

work love song joy
all happi hour employ
sick troubl want pain

there shall He laugh d scorn
wore pierc crown thorn
hear prais sweetest chord
king king lord lord

O may life pass d
join happi throng last
through great redeem blood
sing dwell god



improv

how mani poor children see everi day
who one guid aright
No wonder vice wander astray
and evil delight

but got good bibl read
and parent anxiou kind
shall prove vile ungrat inde
If still pervers inclin

these bless rise god terribl bar
If grow better
and bibl neglect also
and friend teacher condemn

then let attend make hast improv
with everi fresh season given
and pray lord merci love
To train virtu heaven
