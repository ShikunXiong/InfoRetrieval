Go back throw smelli thing away

sure chiswick would perceiv shame
clutch indec whirl round
and flung like torch flame
and great wail swept across sound
As though deep call back kith
said It go hammersmith

It go beyond chelsea flat
and hang barg battersea
will press past wap decay cat
and dead dog shall bear compani
small bath boy shall feel clammi prod
and think jellyfish fled surg
and twill win tribe cod
In ooz inton fit dirg

the morn dawn the tide strip shore
and foul shape fanci remot

No neighbour garden sit

but shall mortifi ageless bone
