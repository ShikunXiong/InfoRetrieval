O No sweet ladi thee
that set chill tone
By feel
So utterli thrown
for mine sprung upon lip
impati express
the haunt charm thi sweet voic
and gentlest loveli
fairi queen thou art
whose spell heart

the garden mani flower
but one thee
the earli grace grecian song
the fragant myrtl tree
for doth speak happi love
the delic true
If pearl bud fair like thee
they seem fragil
like omen love power
will watch preciou flower

thou art wilder race
upon mountain side
abl alik summer sun
and winter blast bide
but thou art gentl growth
which ask love eye
To keep sweet guardianship
Or must droop die
requir equal love care
even delic fair

paint thee charm
which thou hast wrought
thi laugh like wild bird song
In first bloomtouch d tree
you spoke love itali
and thousand flower
your lip caught music breath
amid summer bowr
and form like thine
ha brave stormi apennin

m stand one white rose
where silver water glide
ve flung white rose stream
how light breast tide
the clear wave seem love
So beauti thing
and fondli scent leav
the laugh sunbeam cling

and sweet ladi thi fate
