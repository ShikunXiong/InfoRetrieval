merci philbrick S choic









to one found us starless night
all helpless grope danger way
where countless treacher hidden pitfal lay
and see peril flash light
To show bewild blind sight
By one swift clear pierc ray
the safe sure path word could reach height
Of great thank and yet
the save poor paltri life
Of flesh littl worth cost
which eager sow may stay reap
and soon breathless strain strife
it work halfdon exhaust fall asleep



but unto find men soul astray
In night know night
walk reckless feet may fall
each moment deadlier death slay
the flesh whose truth rend away
from lost soul moral night black pall
Oh unto word heart recal
which deep gratitud find fit say
No word best
that henceforth like quenchless vestal flame
hi word truth shall burn truth pure shrine
hi memori truth worship confess
our gratitud love priestess line
who serv truth altar name
