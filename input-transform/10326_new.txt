the name jonathan remain ever perfect pattern
friendship

let us think littl today nobl charact
tragic histori It sure us good If noth
make us somewhat asham almost best
thing happen us man

We first hear jonathan gallant deed We might
expect much It greatheart men true
friend mean cowardli men never know friendship mean

the israelit hidden thicket cave pit
fear philistin jonathan suddenli inspir
attack philistin garrison circumst seemingli
desper and first slaughter jonathan
armourbear made twenti men within
halfacr land yoke oxen might plough

that one littl hint shew stori
true written man knew place probabl
great battl bethaven follow perhap
ascend rock jonathan done valiant deed
seen dead bodi lie fallen
armourbear

then follow stori david kill goliath come back
saul giant head hand answer modestli
son thi servant jess bethlehemit

and came pass made end speak unto saul
soul jonathan knit soul david
jonathan love soul

then jonathan david made coven love
soul

and jonathan strip robe upon
gave david garment even sword
bow girdl

He love soul and becaus soul like
soul david modest love david modesti
brave love david courag
virtuou love david virtu He saw david
therefor love
soul and therefor said nobl great heart
great friendship admir delight
men good see great godlik man
conceiv like jonathan affect forget
think till anyth
sacrific anyth jonathan david

for rememb jonathan caus hate envi david rather
love would hate
touch mean selfish heart gradual
learnt israel learnt samuel anoint david
king jonathan danger succeed
saul death david stood kingdom and yet
envi david join father moment plot
ruin He would oppos father secretli inde
respect still would true david though
bear insult threat death

and mark one element jonathan great friendship jonathan
piou man well righteou one He believ lord
messag chosen david king submit see
right david worthi honour
though hurt children
It lord instead repin must
carri far concern ye
true fellowmen alway true god
spirit god make fear god make also
love neighbour

when david escap saul samuel jonathan
save the two friend meet secretli field

and jonathan said unto david O lord god israel
sound father tomorrow time third day
behold good toward david send unto
thee shew thee lord much jonathan

then david jonathan agre upon sign
david may know saul humour without bowbear find
david He shoot three arrow toward place david
hide say bowbear the arrow
side thee david come safe but say the
arrow beyond thee david must flee life lord
sent away

then jonathan goe meat father saul excus
david absent

then saul anger kindl jonathan said unto
thou son pervers rebelli woman know
thou hast chosen son jess thine confus unto
confus thi mother for long son jess liveth
upon ground thou shalt establish thi kingdom
wherefor send fetch unto shall sure die
and jonathan answer saul father said unto wherefor
shall slain hath done and saul cast javelin
smite wherebi jonathan knew determin
father slay david

He goe field shoot arrow give sign
agre He send bowbear back citi david

and soon lad gone david aros place toward
south fell face ground bow
three time kiss one anoth wept one anoth

forasmuch sworn us name lord
say the lord thee seed thi
seed ever and aros depart jonathan went
citi

and two friend part saw one anoth seem
jonathan went david forest ziph
strengthen hand god nobl word

after jonathan vanish stori david We hear

struggl probabl made seen day
like jonathan fell david rais famou
lament

O jonathan thou wast slain thine high place distress
thee brother jonathan pleasant hast thou unto
thi love wonder pass love women how
mighti fallen weapon war perish

So end beauti tragic stori truli gallant man
seldom inde seen world perfect
friendship man man jonathan david

selfish interest would teach hate supplant
but still everi man may ought friend wretch
