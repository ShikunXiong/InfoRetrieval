the seaflow


what love well childhood home
It wide wavelash shore black rock crown foam
It seagul flap wing trackless flight
it scream note welcom fierc stormi night

nor scene half bright enough win young heart sea
No t ocean vast deep fathomless free
the mighti rush water ever dear

eliza cook


but goodli pearl merchant bought
and gave
wa purer pearl eer brought
