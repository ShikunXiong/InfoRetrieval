He stand us screen
By good deed sun

hi love line long drawn
yet lasteth firm unto end
hi heart oak yet unto us
It like gentlest reed bend

fight soldier
yet manner would guess
that whole long life spent
In scene countri quiet

Or would scorch ember shake

Of pang discern

T reproach not suffer
If thou shouldst soldier

If without soldier fame

Do littl pain
On thi manhood bring stain

poetic version OF AN ancient talk

In day yore ancient stori tell
king love great princess fell
long feet submiss monarch sigh d
while stern repuls suit deni
yet form d birth pleas fair
dress d danc d court monarch air
but magic spell frozen breast steel d
with stubborn pride knew yield

thi king courteou fairi told
and bade monarch suit bold
for would charm princess wed
had cat black tail tread
when straight spell would vanish air
and enjoy life yield fair

He thank d fairi kind advice
thought If ll nice
rather courtship fail
mincemeat tread minon black tail

To princess court repair strait
He sought cat must decid fate
but found creatur stare
how back bristl great eye glare
that tail fondli hop d prize
wa swell d wrath twice usual size
and cattish gestur plainli spoke
she thought affair came upon joke
with wari step cautiou king draw near
and slyli mean attack rear
but think upon tail pounc
whisk skip three yard upon bounc
again tri effort fail
minon witch deuc tail

the anxiou chase week monarch tri
till courag fail d hope within die
desper suit t useless prefer
Or hope catch tail quicksilver
when day beyond hope found
minon foe asleep upon ground
her ampl tail behind lay outspread
full eye tempt tread
the king raptur occas bless d
and quick foot fatal part press d
loud squall heard like howl storm
and sad gaze minon alter form
No cat chang d man
Of giant size frown d thu began

rash king dare impiou design
To violat tail mine
what though spell broke burst charm
that kept princess thi long arm
not unreveng shall thou furi dare
for violat tail swear
from unhappi nuptial shall born
princ whose nose shall thi subject scorn
bless d love thi son shall never
till foul deform shall see
till tear blemish shall confess
discern odiou length wish less

thi said vanish d king awhil
muse word answer d smile
give child happi wedlock born
and let nose made like french horn
hi knowledg fact neer doubt
If eye hand ll find

So spake king selfflatt d thought
then impati step princess sought
hi urgent suit longer withstand
but link hymen knot hand

almost soon widow bride
within year king husband die
and shortli dead gone
she deliv d littl son
the prettiest babe lip red rose
and eye like littl star nose
the tender mother fondli took boy
into arm would kiss d joy
hi luckless nose forbad fond embrac
He thrust hideou featur face

then maid honour tri turn
and princ kiss envi burn
By sad experi taught hope miss d
and mourn d princ never could kiss d

In silent tear queen confess d grief
till kindest flatteri came relief
her maid one take arm
expati freeli oer world charm
hi eye lip mouth forehead divin
and nose call aquilin
declar caesar world subdu
had one longitud
that king like compel folk ador
and drove shortno d son men
that length nose portend length day
and great advantag mani way
To mourn gift provid wrong
besid the nose long

these argument part grief redrest
mother partial fond rest
and time thing reconcil use
did notion chang produc
that view babe favour blind
she think handsomest human kind

meantim spite disfigur face
doru call d grew apac
In fair proport featur rose
save promin nose
that nose infant could annoy
wa grown perfect nuisanc boy
whene walk d handl went
long snout ferret wild boar
Or like staff holi day
the solemn parish beadl clear way

but cradl latest year
how seldom truth reach princ ear
To keep th unwelcom knowledg view
hi lesson well flatter courtier knew
the hoari tutor wili page
unmeet confeder dupe tender age
they taught whate vain mortal boast
strength courag wisdom valu
whate human life distinct throw
wa compris length nose
Ev n virtu self suppo d chief merit
In shortnos folk want spirit

while doctrin guid instil d

At court whoever ventur appear
