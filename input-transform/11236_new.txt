secur rest upon wave
for thou O lord hast pow r save

for thou dost note sparrow fall
and calm peac sleep

Or though tempest fieri breath
rou d sleep wreck death
In ocean cave still safe thee

the minstrel boy


the minstrel boy war gone
In rank death ll find
hi father sword gird
and wild harp slung behind him
land song said warriorbard
though world betray thee
one sword least thi right shall guard
one faith harp shall prais thee
the minstrel fell foeman chain
could bring proud soul
the harp love neer spoke
for tore cord asund
and said No chain shall sulli thee
thou soul love braveri
thi song made brave free
they shall never sound slaveri

ON the bank OF allan water


On bank allan water
when sweet springtim fall
wa miller love daughter
the fairest
for bride soldier sought
and win tongu
On bank allan water
none gay

On bank allan water
when brown autumn spread store
then saw miller daughter
but smile
for summer grief brought
and soldier fals
On bank allan water
none sad

On bank allan water
when winter snow fell fast
still seen miller daughter
chill blew blast
but miller love daughter
both cold care free
On bank allan water
there corps lay

Of fine old english gentleman
who old estat
and kept old mansion
At bounti old rate

with pike gun bow
and sword good old buckler
that stood old foe
T worship sat state
In doublet trunk hose
and quaff d cup good old sack
To warm good old nose
like fine old english gentleman

when winter cold brought frost snow
He open d hous
and though threescor ten year
He featli led ball
nor houseless wander
eer driven hall
for feast great
He neer forgot small
like fine old english gentleman
all olden time

but time though sweet strong flight
and year roll swiftli
and autumn fall leav proclaim d
the old man must die
He laid quit tranquilli
gave latest sigh
and mourn still reign d around
and tear bedew d eye
for good old english gentleman

Of theatr fanci ball
At home masquerad
and much econom

then leav new vagari quit
and take old trade
Of fine old english gentleman

By lightn vivid power

In bay biscay O

To cling slippri shroud

As lay till day

At length wishedfor morrow

when blackey susan came board
Oh shall true love find

If sweet william sail among crew

He sigh cast eye

and quick lightn deck stand

So sweet lark high pois air

If chanc mate shrill call hear
and drop nest
the noblest captain british fleet
might envi william lip kiss sweet

Oh susan susan love dear
My vow shall ever true remain
let kiss fall tear
We part meet
chang ye list ye wind heart shall
the faith compass still point thee

believ landsmen say
who tempt doubt thi constant mind
they tell thee sailor away
In everi port mistress find

for thou art present wheresoe go

If fair india coast sail

though battl call thi arm
let pretti susan mourn
though cannon roar yet free harm

love turn asid ball round fli
lest preciou tear drop susan eye

No longer must stay board

the leather bottel


T god made thing
the heavn earth therein
the ship sea swim
To guard foe none come
and let
T one end use man
So wish heav n soul may dwell
that first found leather bottel

now say can wood
Oh faith good
for bearer fall way
whi ground liquor doth lay
but leather bottel
although fallen well
So wish heav n soul may dwell
that first found leather bottel

then say glass fine
Oh shall prais mine
for chanc touch brim
down fall liquor therein
but leather bottel
and stoppl well
So wish heav n soul may dwell
that first found leather bottel

then say black pot three
If man wife agre
whi ll tug pull till liquor doth spill
In leather bottel may tug fill
and pull away till heart ake
and yet liquor harm take
So wish heav n soul may dwell
that first found leather bottel

then say flagon fine
Oh shall prais mine
for lord dine
and send fill wine
the man flagon doth run away
becaus silver gallant gay
So wish heav n soul may dwell
that first found leather bottel

leather bottel know good
far better glass can wood
for man work field
your glass pot comfort yield
but good leather bottel stand
will rais spirit whenev dri
So wish heav n soul may dwell
that first found leather bottel

At noon haymak sit
To drink bottl ale nutbrown
In summer weather warm
good bottl full harm
then lad lass begin tottl
but would without bottl
So wish heav n soul may dwell
that first found leather bottel

there never lord earl knight
but bottl doth take delight
for hunt deer
He oft doth wish bottl beer
likewis man work wood
bottl beer oft good
So wish heav n soul may dwell
that first found leather bottel

and bottl last grow old
and good liquor longer hold
out side may take clout
To mend shoe re worn
Or take hang pin
twill serv put hing old thing
So wish heav n soul may dwell
that first found leather bottel




woodman spare that tree


woodman spare tree
touch singl bough
In youth shelter d
and ll protect

there woodman let stand
thi axe shall harm
that old familiar tree
whose glori renown

say wouldst thou hack

woodman forbear thi stroke

Oh spare age oak

Of mani forest bird

Oh let old oak stand

My heartstr round thee cling

To press hand within wipe away tear

O nanni wilt thou GO with ME


O nanni wilt thou go
nor sigh leav flaunt town
can silent glen charm thee

No longer drest silken sheen
No longer deck d jewel rare

where thou wert fairest fair

O nanni thourt far away
wilt thou cast wish behind
say canst thou face parch ray
nor shrink wintri wind
Oh soft gentl mien
extrem hardship learn bear
nor sad regret courtli scene
where thou wert fairest fair

O nanni canst thou love true
through peril keen go
Or thi swain mishap shall rue
To share pang woe
say diseas pain befal
wilt thou assum nurs care
nor wist gay scene recal
where thou wert fairest fair

and last thi love shall die
wilt thou receiv part breath
wilt thou repress struggl sigh
and cheer smile bed death
and wilt thou oer breathless clay
strew flower drop tender tear
nor regret scene gay
where thou wert fairest fair
