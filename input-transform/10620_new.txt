IN memori OF mr john fletcher

me thought our fletcher weari croud
wherein witt yet loud
unto elyzium fled alon
might witt admir bemoan
but soon upon flowri bank throng
worthi even number sung
appear though ancient laureat strive
when dead whose raptur surviv
for templ own bay allow
not sham d see crown d nake browes
homer hi beautifull achil nam d
urg brain with jove might well fam d
sinc brought forth one full beauti charm
As palla bold arm king king
but brave arbas saw one
that save peopl danger
and saw tigran bi hand undon
without help any mirmydon
he confess d next hee d hector slay
that must borrow fletcher play
thi might been shame bid
his iliad in nutshel hid
virgil of his aenea next begun
whose godlik form tongu soon wonn
that queen of carthag and beauti
two power whole world els slave unto
urg princ repair fault
On earth boldli hell mistress sought the maid tragedy
but he amintor saw reveng wrong
for sad aspasia sigh d long
upon himself shade hast away
not make visit stay
He modestli confess farr
fletcher outdid charactar
now lastli refuge virgil shew
the line where corydon alexi woe
but opposit quickli met the faithful shepherdesse
the smooth tongud perigot and amoret
A pair doubtless other seen
they own love had apost been
thus fletcher did fam d laureat exceed
both trumpet sound reed
now ancient yeeld heretofor
none worthyer ere laurel wore
the least age say thou art gon
Is never one
and sinc express thi worth rime narrow
To help wee l ampl prophesie

nor need thi juster titl foul guilt
Of eastern king secur raign

when labour sink weight

and lend ladi eye power bright
dispens thu either heat light
He sympathi soul betrai d
whom love beauti never could perswad
and mov d spectatour could beget
reall passion counterfeit
when first bellario bled ladi
did everi drop let fall tear
and when aspasia wept eye

By inspir feigned lucina drew

but the scornful ladi did beguil
their easi grief teach smile

Of lightning glory eye

Of evry speciou bayte evri snare

Of gravity busnesse the lukewarme

On dramatick poem Mr john fletcher

wonder  fletcher long buri

shake fetter better bound
and may rightli understood
prove play lawful hath made good
i any lover mad see here love cure
unmarri a wife he may sure
rare one for moneth if displeas
the spanish curat give writ eas
enquire the custom countri then
shall french lawyer set free again
If two fair maid take wondrou ill
one of inn the of mill
that th  lover progress stopt defam d
here makes women plea d and tamer tamd
but play the coxcomb or trie
his wit several weapon or els die
nice valour and doubt engag
the nobl gentlman in love pilgrimag
to take reveng the fals one and run
the honest man fortun to undon
like knight malta or else captain be
Or th  humer lieuten goe sea
voyag for starv hee loath
till peac swear oath
that the loyal subject may leav
To lye from begger bush and undec
the creditor discharg debt whi
sinc ca nt pay to fletcher what owe
Oh could his prophetess but tell one chanc
when the pilgrim shall return franc
and make kingdom late
the island princess and celebr
A doubl marriag everi one bring
to fletcher memori offer
that thu last unsequest stage
bring back silver golden age

Ah none weep worthi tear

In peic dash straight again

Of stone wood hold fear blow
and wee ancient hoari head see
whose wit never mortal
beaumont di young so sidney did

If th art self unto pitch could grow

To pass fire laugh hour bed

upon Mr fletcher

incompar play

the poet live wonder why
fletcher reviv er e could dye
safe mirth full languag flow evri page
At doth both heighten and aswag
all innoc wit pleasant clear
nor church nor law were ever libel d
but fair deduct drawn great brain
enough conquer thats fals or vain
he scatter wit senc freeli fling
that very citizen speak handsom thing
teach their wive such unaffect grace
their look are handsom their face
nor violent steal upon
the yeild soul until the phrensi gone
hi very launc do patient pleas
a good musick cure a mad diseas
small poet rifl him yet think fair
becaus rob man well spare
they feed upon owe everi bit

On mr john fletc H ER ever admir dramatical work

I ve thought upo nt thu may gain bay
commend thee fletcher and thi play

there way il throng sit
and pass h croud amongst wit
apollo know nine
all pretenc vers love wine
By leav gentlemen you wit oth age
you furnisht judg d stage
you poet actor fright
least censur thin second night
pray tell gallant wit could critick think
there ere solaecism in fletcher ink
Or laps plot fanci pen
happiness still alow d to ben
after time wit had cost
He own newinn host
inspired fletcher here vaineglori word
how ev n thi line smooth thi sens accord
thi languag insinu one
Of thi spectat thi passion
men see valiant ladi amor prove
thu owe thee valour love
scene chast yet satisfi ladi ca nt say
though stephen miscarri d play
judgement could ne re opinion lean
that lowen tailor ere could grace thi scene
T richli good unact
thi fars appear comedi
thi drolleri design looser part
stuff thi play make em art
the stage seldom seen often vice
Is smartli scourg d check us intic
how well encourag d vertu guard
and make us love reward
some dare say loos thought sit
reclaim d thee came convert pit
and mani tane came

As formerli before tom coryat

To perish for witti coppi took
Of his encomium made a book

most knowing johnson proud call him sonn

hi self I knew till dy

Of sorrow overwhelm d the stage which gave
volley sigh send grave
and grew distract violent fit
for she had lost best part her wit
in first yeer famous fletcher fell
Of good king charl who grace these poem well

Of the king second com court
