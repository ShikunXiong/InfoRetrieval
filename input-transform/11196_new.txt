To golden gittern tinkl tune
while thousand lustr shimmer stream
In palac grand saloon

while unseen spirit walk besid
and unheard lover talk
He claimeth one bride

Oh maud madg dream togeth

Of beard lip press

robinson OF leyden


He sleep hope prayer
hi wander flock gone
but shepherd might share
their sorrow wintri shore

befor speedwel anchor swung
ere yet mayflow sail spread
while round feet pilgrim clung
the pastor spake thu said

men brethren sister children dear
god call henc sea
Ye may build haerlem meer
nor yet along zuyderze

Ye go bear save word
To tribe unnam shore untrod
heed well lesson ye heard
from old teacher taught god

yet think unto lent
all light come day
and heaven etern wisdom spent
In make straight ancient way

the live fountain overflow
for everi flock everi lamb
nor heed though angri creed oppos
with luther dike calvin dam

He spake linger long embrac
with tear love part fond
they float creep maa
along isl ysselmond

they pass frown tower briel
the hook holland shelf sand
and grate soon lift keel
the sullen shore fatherland

No home well knew
the mitr king behind throne
the sail set pennon flew
and westward ho world unknown

and gave us birth
the pilgrim sunset wave
who us virgin earth
and freedom soil gave

the pastor slumber rhine
In alien earth exil lie
their nameless grave holiest shrine
hi word noblest battlecri

still cri world shall hear
Ye dweller stormswept sea
Ye have built haerlem meer
nor landlock zuyderze
