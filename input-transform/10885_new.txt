stori OF paulo and francesca

poscia ch ebbi il mio dottor udito
nomar le donn antich e cavalieri
pieta mi vins e fui quasi smarrito

cominciai poeta volentieri
parlerei que duo nsiem vanno
E pajon si al vento esser leggieri

Ed egli vedrai quando saranno
piu presso noi e tu allor gli piega
per quell amor ch ei mena e quei verranno

Si tosto come l vento noi gli piega
mossi la voce O anim affann
venit parlar altri nol niega

quali colomb dal disio chiamat
con l ali apert e ferm al dolc nido
volan per l aer dal voter portat

cotali uscir de la schiera ov e dido
noi venendo per l aer maligno
Si fort fu l affettuoso grido

O anim grazioso e benigno
che visitando vai per l aer perso
noi che tignemmo mondo di sanguigno
Se foss amico il Re de luniverso
noi pregheremmo lui per la tua pace
poich hai pieta del nostro mal perverso

Di quel chudir e che parlar ti piac
noi udiremo e parleremo vui
mentr che l vento come fa si tace

sied la terra dove nata fui
Su la marina dove l Po discend
per aver pace co seguaci sui

amor chal cor gentil ratto sapprend
prese costui de la bella persona
che mi fu tolta e l modo ancor moffend

amer ch nullamato amar perdona
Mi prese del costui piacer si fort
che come vedi ancor non mabbandona

amor conduss noi ad una mort
caina attend chi n vita ci spens
quest parol da lor ci fur port

Da chio ntesi quellanim offens
chinai l viso e tanto l tenni basso
finch l poeta mi diss che pens

quando risposi cominciai O lasso
quanti dolci pensier quanto disio
meno costoro al doloroso passo

Po mi rivolsi loro e parla io
E cominciai francesca tuoi martiri
lagrimar mi fanno tristo e pie

Ma dimmi al tempo de dolci sospiri
che e come concedett amor
che conoscest dubbiosi desiri

Ed ella nessun maggior dolor
che ricordarsi del tempo felic
Ne la miseria e cio sa l tuo dottor
Ma conosc la prima radic
del nostro amor hai cotanto affetto
faro come colui piang e dice

noi leggiavamo tin giorno per diletto
Di lancilotto come amor strins
soli eravamo e senza alcun sospetto

per piu fiat gli occhi ci sospins
quella lettura e scolorocci l viso
Ma solo un punto fu quel che ci vins

quando leggemmo il disiato riso
esser baciato da cotanto amant
questi che mai da non sia diviso

La bocca mi bacio tutto tremant
galeotto fu il libro e chi scriss
quel giorno piu non leggemmo avant

mentr luno spirto questo diss
laltro piangeva si che di pietad
venni men cosi com io moriss

E caddi come corpo morto cade

stori OF ugolino

non eravam partiti gia da ello
Ch vidi duo ghiacciati una buca
Si che lun capo laltro era capello

E come l pan per fame si manduca
cosi l sovran li denti laltro pose
La ve l cervel saggiung con la nuca

non altrimenti tideo si rose
Le tempi menalippo per disdegno
che quei faceva l teschio e laltr cose

O tu che mostri per si bestial segno
odio sovra colui che tu ti mangi
dimmi l perch diss io per tal convegno

che se tu ragion di lui ti piangi
sappiendo chi voi siet e la sua pecca
nel mondo suso ancor io te ne cangi

Se quella con ch parlo non si secca

La bocca sollevo dal fiero pasto
quel peccat forbendola capelli
del capo ch egli avea diretro guasto

poi comincio tu vuoi ch rinnovelli
disperato dolor l cuor mi preme
gia pur pensando pria ch ne favelli

Ma se le mie parol esser den seme
che frutti infamia al traditor ch rodo
parlar e lagrimar vedrai insiem

non chi tu sei ne per che modo
venuto se qua giu fiorentino
Mi sembri verament quand odo

Tu de saper ch fu l cont ugolino
E questi l arcivescovo ruggieri
Or ti diro perch son tal vicino

che per l effetto de suo pensieri
fidandomi di lui io fossi preso
E poscia morto dir non e mestieri

pero quel che non puoi aver inteso
cioe come la mort mia fu cruda
udirai e saprai se ha offeso

breve pertugio dentro da la muda
La qual per ha l titol da la fame
E n che convien ancor ch altrui si chiuda

M avea mostrato per lo suo foram
piu lone gia quand feci l mal sonno
che del futuro mi squarcio l velam

questi pareva maestro e donno
cacciando l lupo e lupicirui al mont
perch pisan veder lucca non ponno

con cagn magr studios e cont
gualandi con sismondi e con lanfranchi
S avea messi dinanzi da la front

In picciol corso mi pareano stanchi
Lo padr e figli e con l agut scane
Mi parea lor veder fender li fianchi

quando fui desto innanzi la diman
pianger senti fra l sonno miei figliuoli
Ch eran con meco e dimandar del pane

ben se crudel se uo gia non ti duoli
pensando cio ch al mio cuor annunziava
E se non piangi di che pianger suoli

gia eram desti e lora sappressava
che l cibo ne soleva esser addotto
E per suo sogno ciascun dubitava

Ed io senti chiavar luscio di sotto
lorribil torr ond io guardai
nel viso miei figliuoi senza far motto

non piangeva si dentro impietrai
piangevan elli ed anselmuccio mio
diss Tu guardi si padr che hai

pero non lagrimai ne rispo io
tutto quel giorno ne la nott appresso
infin che laltro sol nel mondo uscio

com un poco di raggio si fu messo
nel doloroso carcer ed io scorsi
per quattro visi il mio aspetto stesso

ambo le mani per dolor mi morsi
E quei pensando ch l fessi per voglia
Di manicar di subito levorsi

E disser padr assai ci sia men doglia
Se tu mangi di noi tu ne vestisti
quest miser carni e tu le spoglia

quetami allor per non fargli piu tristi
quel di e laltro stemmo tutti muti
ahi dura terra perch non tapristi

posciach fummo al quarto di venuti
gaddo mi si gitto disteso piedi
dicendo padr mio che non ajuti

quivi mori e come tu mi vedi
vid io cascar li tre ad uno ad uno
tra l quinto di e l sesto ond mi diedi

gia cieco brancolar sovra ciascuno
E tre di gli chiamai poich e fur morti
poscia piu che l dolor pote l digiuno

quand ebb detto cio con gli occhj torti
ripres l teschio misero co denti
che furo losso come un forti

ahi pisa vituperio de le genti
del bel paes la dove l si suona
poich vicini te punir son lenti

muovasi la capraja e la gorgona
E faccian siep ad arno su la foce
Si ch egli annieghi te ogni persona

che se l cont ugolino aveva voce
daver tradita te de le castella
non dovei tu figliuoi porr tal croce

innocenti facea l eta novella
novella tebe uguccion e l brigata
E gli altri duo che l canto suso appella

fiorenza dentro da la cerchia antica
ond ella togli ancora e terza e nona
Si stava pace sobria e pudica

non avea catenella non corona
non donn contigi non cintura
che foss veder piu che la persona

non faceva nascendo ancor paura
La figlia al padr che l tempo e la dott
non fuggian quindi e quindi la misura

non avea case di famiglia vote
non vera giunto ancor sardanapalo
mostrar cio che n camera si puot

non era vinto ancora montemalo
dal vostro uccellatojo che com e vinto
nel montar su cosi sara nel calo

bellincion berti vid io andar cinto
Di cuojo e dosso e venir da lo specchio
La donna sua sanza l viso dipinto

E vidi quel de nerli e quel del vecchio
esser contenti la pell scoverta
E le sue donn al fuso ed al pennecchio

O fortun e ciascuna era certa
De la sua sepoltura ed ancor nulla
era per francia nel lotto deserta

luna vegghiava studio de la culla
E consolando usava lidioma
che pria li padri e le madri trastulla

laltra traendo la rocca la chioma
favoleggiava con la sua famiglia
Di trojani e di fiesol e di roma

saria tenuta allor tal maraviglia
una cianghella un lapo salterello
qual saria cincinnato e corniglia

Di sopra la badia vera un gran mont

De quali uno avea nome passamont

Ed ogni di facevan qualch assalto

come colui che di maria gia nacqu
adora ed era cristian battezzato
E com egli era la badia arrivato

diss l abat Il ben venuto sia
Di quel ch io ho volenti ti daremo

E la cagion cavali ti diremo

orlando bujaforte

La battaglia veniva rinforzando
E ogni part apparisc la mort
E mentr qua e la combatt orlando
Un tratto caso trovo bujafort
E su la testa gli dett col brando
E perch lelmo e temperato e fort
O fors incantato era al colpo ha retto
Ma de la testa gli balzo di netto

orlando prese costui per le chiom
E diss dimmi se non ch io tuccido
Di questo tradimento appunto e come
E se tu il di de la mort ti fido
E vo che tu mi dica presto il nome
ond il pagan rispos con gran grido
aspetta bujafort io te lo dico
De la montagna del veglio tuo amico

orlando quando intes il giovinetto
subito al padr suo raffigurollo
lascio la chioma e poi labbraccio stretto
per tenerezza e con lelmo baciollo
E diss O bujafort il vero hai detto
Il veglio mio e da canto tirollo
Di questo tradimento dimmi appunto
poi cosi la fortuna ha giunto

Ma ben ti dico per la fede mia
che di combatt con mie genti hai torto
E che l padr tuo dovunqu e sia
non ti perdona questo cosi morto
bujafort piangeva tuttavia
poi diss orlando mio datti conforto
Il mio signor forza qua mi manda
E obbedir convien quel che comanda

Io son de la mia patria sbandeggiato
marsilio cort sua ha ritenuto
E promesso rimettermi istato
Io vo cercando consiglio ed ajuto
poi ch io son da ognuno abbandonato
E per questa cagion qua son venuto
E bench mostri far grand schermaglia
non ho morto nessun ne la battaglia

Io ho tanto per fama ricordar
sentito tutto il mondo che nel core
sempr poi ebbi e mi puoi comandar
E del padr mio lantico amor
del tradimento tu tel puoi pensar
sai che gano e marsilio e traditor
E per discrezion tu intendi bene
che tanta gent per tua mort vien

E baldovin di marsilio ha la vesta
che cosi il vostro gano ba ordinato
vedi che ignun non gli pon lancia resta
che l signor nostro ce lha comandato
diss orlando rimetti lelmo testa
E torna la battaglia al modo usato
vedrem che segnira tanto ti dico
Ch io taro sempr come il veglio amico

poi diss aspetta un poco intendi saldo
che non ti punga qualch strana ortica
sappi ch egli e ne la zuffa rinaldo
guarda che il nome per nulla non dica
che non dicess quella furia caldo
dunqu tu se da la part nimica
Si che tu giuochi netto destro e largo
che ti bisogua aver qui gli occhi dargo

rispos bujafort bene hai detto
Se la battaglia passera tuo modo
Ti mostrero che amico son perfetto
come fu il padr mio ch ancor ne godo

the poor youth take way fight unfortun meet
rinaldo

rinaldo ritrovo quel bujafort
Al mio parer che sarebb scoppiato
Se non avess trovato la mort
E come egli ebb parlar cominciato
del marsilio e di stare suo cort
rinaldo gli rispos infuriato
chi non e ineco avverso sia detto
E cominciogli trassinar lelmetto
E trass un mandiretto e due e tre
con tanta furia e quattro e cinqu e sei
che non ebb agio domandar merz
E morto cadd sanza dire omei

orlando baldwin

orlando poi che lascio bujafort
pargli millanni trovar baldovino
che cerca pure e non truova la mort
E ricognobb il caval vegliantino
per la battaglia e va correndo fort
dov era orlando e diceva il meschino
sappi ch io ho fatto oggi il mio dovuto
E contra nessun mai e venuto

molti pagani ho pur fatti morir
pero quel che cio sia pensar non posso
Se non ch io veggo la gent fuggir
rispos orlando Tu ti fai ben grosso
Di questo fatto stu ti vuoi chiarir
La soppravvesta ti cava di dosso
vedrai che gan come tu te la cavi
Ci ha venduti marsilio per ischiavi

rispos baldwin Se il padr mio
Ci ha qui condotti come traditor
S posso oggi campar pel nostro iddio
con questa spada passerogli il core
Ma traditor orlando non io
Ch io ho seguito con perfetto amor
non mi potresti dir maggior ingiuria
poi si straccio la vesta con gran furia

E diss Io tornero ne la battaglia
poi che tu hai per traditor scorto
Io non son traditor se dio mi vaglia
non mi vedrai piu oggi se non morto
E verso lost de pagan si scaglia
dicendo sempr Tu hai fatto torto
orlando si pentea daver cio detto
che disperato vide il giovinetto

per la battaglia cornea baldovino
E riscontro quel crudel mazzarigi
E diss Tu se qui saracino
per distrugg la gent di parigi
O marran rinnegato paterino
Tu sarai presto giu ne bassi stigi
E trass con la spada modo questo
che lo mando dov egli diss presto

orlando meet baldwin kept word

orlando cors le grida e l romor
E trovo baldovino il poveretto
Ch era gia presso lultim sue ore
E da due lanc avea passato il petto
E diss Or non son io piu traditor
E cadd terra morto cosi detto
De la qual cosa duolsi orlando fort
E pians esser cagion de la sua mort
