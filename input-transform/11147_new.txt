WE are seven


BY WM wordsworth


simpl child
that lightli draw breath
and feel life everi limb

met littl cottag girl
she eight year old said
her hair thick mani curl
that cluster round head

she rustic woodland air
and wildli clad
her eye fair fair
her beauti made glad

sister brother littl maid
how mani may
how mani seven said
and wonder look

illustr

and pray tell
she answer seven
and two us conway dwell
and two gone sea

two us churchyard lie
My sister brother
and churchyard cottag
dwell near mother

you say two conway dwell
and two gone sea
yet ye seven pray tell
sweet maid may

then littl maid repli
seven boy girl
two us churchyard lie
beneath churchyard tree

you run littl maid
your limb aliv
If two churchyard laid
then ye five

their grave green may seen
the littl maid repli
twelv step mother door
and side side

My stock often knit
My kerchief hem

illustr the churchyard

and upon ground sit
sit sing

and often sunset sir
when light fair
take littl porring
and eat supper

the first die littl jane
In bed moan lay
till god releas pain
and went away

So churchyard laid
and grass dri
togeth round grave play
My brother john

and ground white snow
and could run slide
My brother john forc go
and lie side

how mani said
If two heaven
the littl maiden repli
O master seven

but dead two dead
their spirit heaven
T throw word away still
the littl maid would
and said nay seven

In vain mother kind advic
In vain master care
He follow evri idl vice
and learnt curs swear

and think grew man
He prosper way
No wick cours never
bring good happi day

without shill purs
Or cot call
poor thoma grew bad wors
and harden d stone

the boy stood burn deck
whenc fled
the flame lit battl wreck
shone round oer dead

yet beauti bright stood
As born rule storm
creatur heroic blood
proud though childlik form

the flame roil would go
without father word
that father faint death
hi voic longer heard

He call aloud say father say
If yet task done
He knew chieftain lay
unconsci son

speak father cri
If may yet gone
and boom shot repli
and fast flame roll

upon brow felt breath
and wave hair
and look lone post death
In still yet brave despair

and shout aloud
My father must stay

while oer fast sail shroud
the wreath fire made way

they wrapt ship splendor wild
they caught flag high
and stream gallant child
like banner sky

there came burst thunder sound
the boy O
ask wind far around
with fragment strew sea

with mast helm pennon fair
that well born part
but noblest thing perish
wa young faith heart

In dark blue sky keep
and often curtain peep
for never shut eye
