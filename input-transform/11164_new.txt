introductori


If read prefac preced page turn back
read you see state use
scientif term plain everi day talk It presum us
young men wish becom good engin read
work old engin We therefor plain
say littl possibl tend confus learner
say said languag would use
field instruct handl engin So
experienc engin think might gone
certain point pleas rememb might
confus less experienc therebi cover point
tri make and yet suppos endeavor
make engin man never saw engin It therefor
necessari tell learner engin made look
like We tri teach build engin rather
handl one built know proper
shape let alon shape We suppos
alreadi know much ordinari water boy
say seen water hauler capabl handl
engin haul water engin
engin would made good water boy reason
lazi want reader stick pin
symptom complaint nt undertak run engin lazi
engin spoil good engin mean get
habit loaf


part first

In order get learner start reason suppos
engin run good run order It would fair
put green boy onto old dilapid wornout engin
might learn fast order get engin run good
shape He might learn fast would get big head
head time got and nt
know boy without head good engin
big head We therefor suppos engin good
run order By good run order mean
proper place ten twenti pound steam
engin start good live pace and let us say
rememb talk lone engin load consid
start new engin start nice easi
twenti pound make mind engin
go nice handl give littl
troubl but requir fifti sixti pound start
want keep eye open someth tight nt take
piec you might get piec would know
oil bear freeli put engin motion run
care see nt find someth get warm
If stop loosen littl start If
still heat loosen find
soon right but rememb loosen littl
time box journal heat loos quickli
tight make troubl
inexperienc nt know whether loos
tight found warm box nt let box take
attent keep eye bear rememb
thresh yet run engin shed
sake engin young engin hope stand
winter get shape good fall run In
meantim find anyth heat tri pump
help along suppos pump injector case
may work right

now suppos go back start new engin slow
start less fifti pound start watch
care found oil thoroughli noth heat far
could see So conclud troubl must
cylind well next must take cylind head look
troubl Oh mean the troubl seriou
the ring littl tight seriou fault keep well
oil day two ten pound start empti engin good

steam run well tri pull relief lever If
let go stop escap steam right
If howev steam continu escap valv stick
chamber usual slight tap wrench hammer stop
never get excit escap steam perhap
good place say nt get excit anyth As
long plenti water know danger

the young engin like wonder said
someth danger explos We start write
explos that nt want anyth
but say danger boiler explod ye
but wish explod boiler must treat
differ way advis We state long

some time ago writer stand near traction engin
engin guess must call ask stay
engin minut consent after gone short time
thought would look water It show two inch
glass right advis propos
know thought would prove tri cock
but attempt tri found lime solid had
hunt engin fellow would secur job
suppos look glass burst
liabl time would shut gaug cock soon
possibl stop escap steam water then would
tri cock find water boiler would
bad boat know whether water shortli
fellow help engin run guess
put way came back ask troubl
tri cock He said Oh nt bother ask
would glass break hi repli Oh wo nt
break now engin spoil mani good engin
blame manufactur now one good reason
depend entir glass gaug anoth equal good
reason glass may fool see trycock may
lime may glass gaug cock say use you

If go away engin leav water boy
anyon might handi leav alon often done
someth goe wrong engin fault you
busi leav say go separ
help fix someth At separ place It
intent tell run end outfit We
could tell want If men separ ca nt
handl get one get boss get one your

outfit mean make money there engin run engin today
wast time enough everi day pay wage

there one thing may littl difficult learn
let engin alon right gave young
fellow recommend farmer want engin
afterward notic happen around immedi pick
wrench commenc loosen first one thing anoth If
engin ever lose recommend job
get one depend give anoth wish say
learner way run engin whenev happen
go around engin never lose opportun see

pick greasi rag instead wrench engin
understand busi attend never pick wrench
unless someth the good engin took greasi
rag use clean engin
time care examin everi part hi main object see
everyth right If found nut loos part
place would taken wrench use

now contrast engin poor one
unfortun hundr poor engin run portabl
traction engin you find poor engin will talk
thi bad habit number one He talk mind
work beginn must forget when tell fire
engin understand import the poor engin
apt ask outsid stay engin goe
separ talk thi bad habit number two even outsid
good engin know whether pump throw
water use whether throw less He
ascertain watch column water glass
hardli know whether throw fuel He nt want steam
go nt know pressur pop valv blow
there may box journal give engin
troubl outsid know noth there dozen
good reason bad habit number two bad

If watch poor engin stop engin
anyth pick wrench go around wrist pin
strike key littl crack draw nut peck away someth
els ca nt see anyth greas dirt when start ten
one wrist pin heat stop loosen
knock now pick rag instead wrench would
hit key would run hand
found right would let alon would gone
balanc engin start engin would
look better wipe got would run well
stop now understand good engin
wear rag wrench poor one wear
wrench rag never bother engin bother If
make lot grief

mention bad habit poor engin may avoid
If care avoid bad habit connect
run engin certain fall good habit
becom good engin

tinker engin

after careless meddl engin come next list

good fireman

what constitut good fireman you doubt heard
express where much smoke must fire
well true good fireman nt make much smoke We
speak fire coal If see smoke ten mile
thresh engin tell kind fireman run
engin continu cloud black smoke
thrown smokestack make mind engin
keep steam also conclud
much coal left time get job
hand see regular interv cloud
smoke go last moment next
moment see noth conclud engin engin
know busi work hard plenti
steam time coal left So let us go
see make differ learn valuabl lesson We
first go engin make smoke find
engin big coal shovel small enough allow
enter fire door you see engin throw two
perhap three shovel coal matter cours see
volum black smoke issu stack engin stand
lean shovel watch steam gaug find
steam nt run fast time coal get hot
enough consum smoke see drop shovel pick
poker throw open fire door commenc vigor punch
dig fire thi start black smoke
time see knee poker punch
undersid grate bar time
oper smoke come less dens think time
throw coal now kept day
must read say overdrawn
see everi day engin fire way work
hard burn great amount coal afraid time
steam run

befor leav let us take look firebox see
full coal least level door We
also see quit pile ash ash pan you better
understand disadvantag way fire visit
next man think good way know thing know
also

well go across man make littl smoke
make regular interv We like find
littl hand shovel He pick take small
amount coal open fire door spread coal nice
grate quickli shut door minut black smoke
thrown minut whi becaus threw
enough replenish fire choke least
minut heat great enough consum smoke
reach stack smoke unconsum fuel gain much
consum We see engin stand around
next minut perfectli eas He least afraid
steam go At end three five minut owe
amount work see pick littl shovel
throw littl coal exactli
stay hour see pick poker We
look firebox see call thin fire
everi part firebox hot We see small pile
ash engin work hard

If happen think buy engin say
last fellow dandi engin that kind engin
want fact case may first man may
better engin nt know fire now nt see
import know fire engin awar
big coal waster say It easi talk fire
littl hand shovel get field get
kind fuel burn see get along well
awar bad coal It much better handl
bad coal good way handl good coal bad way learn
handl fuel proper way good fireman
Do nt get careless blame coal fault
Be care might give away seen
engin make big kick fuel claim good
fellow would take hold engin troubl
