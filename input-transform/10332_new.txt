He would stretch put empty hand bless
Or lift pray
but alack lighten man distress
they move way

famin came heart still
As hard pride high
and starv poor throng d door
To curs die

At length crowd rose clamour loud
that cruel plot laid
He open d one granari wide
and bade enter free

In rush d maid sire
and child could bare run
then clo d barn set fire
and burnt everi one

and loud laugh d terribl shriek
and cri archertrain
the merri mice shrill squeak
they fond bishop grain

but mark aw judgment soon
On cruel bishop fell
with mani mice palac swarm d
that could dwell

they gnaw d arra beneath
they eat savouri dish
and shortli sacrilegi teeth
began nibbl bishop

He flew castl ehrenfel
By side rhine fair
but found road new abod
and came legion

He built hast tower tall
In tide better assur
but swam river scal d wall
and worri past endur

one morn skeleton seen
By load flesh lighter
they pick bone uncommonli clean
and eaten mitr

As night feast victori held within wall
and conqueror fill winecup high year bright blood shed
but lord king arragon midst triumph wail dead

He look fortress tent tower
the moonlit sea torchlit street gloom came oer brow
the voic thousand float horn cymbal tone
but heart midst proud music felt utterli alon
and cri thou art mine fair citi thou citi sea
but oh portion delight mine last thee
lone midst thi palac glad wave past roll
and soft breath thine orangebow mourn soul

My brother oh brother thou art gone true brave
and haughti joy victori hath die upon thi grave
there mani round throne stand march lead
there one love world brother thou art gone

In desert battl oceantempest wrath
We stood togeth side side one hope one path
thou hast wrapt thi soldier cloak thou hast fenc thi breast
thou hast watch besid couch pain oh bravest heart best

see festiv light around oer dull sad world shine
hear voic victori pedro thine
the voic whose kind tone spirit found repli
Oh brother bought dear hollow pageantri

host gallant fleet spread glori sway
and chief lead fearlessli friend hath pass away
for kindli look word cheer heart may thirst vain
and face light mine come

made thi blood thi faith blood offer crown
with love earth bestow twice purchas cold renown
how often weari heart midst sound triumph die
when think thee brother thou flower chivalri

lone lone rest ev n death
let hear ring spear battletrumpet breath
let see fieri charger foam royal banner wave
but art thou brother thi low earli grave

and louder swell song joy victori night
and faster flow red wine forth star torch light
