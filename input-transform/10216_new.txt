what make the summer


It lark clear tone
cleav morn air soar cri
nor nightingal dulcet melodi balmi night
not alon
make sweet sound summer
but drone beetl bee murmur hum fli
and chirp cricket hidden sight
these help make summer

not rose redli blown
nor golden lili light duski mead
nor proud imperi pansi queencup quaint rare
not alon
make sweet sight summer
but countless forest leav myriad waysid weed
and slender grass spring everywher
these help make summer

one heaven bend
the lowliest head ofttim sweetest rest
oer songbird pine bee ivi low
Is love god summer
well pleas He patient best
So hum littl bee low green grass grow
you help make summer



the brother


high rocki cliff gray old castl stand
from whenc roughbeard chieftain led vassal rule

for centuri dwelt sire son till befel
last ancient line two brother alon dwell

the eldest sternvisag youngest smooth fair
Of counten zealou men bent knee prayer
To god alon love much read much hi holi word
and pray gift desir might see

for elder brother carv silent cell stone
and deep dreari depth enter dwelt alon
and strove scourg vigil fast purifi gaze
and sought amidst shadow behold master face

and love god smile us bright
lip flower
and smile god fall sunlight golden shower
that thrill earth slumber heart warm ray fall
that laugh beauti turn tempter

from birdsong run morn sweetscent chalic oer
cheer
the child light laughter lift lowliest soul heaven near
from tear glad smile link light gloom
golden day
He count temptat auster turn away

and thu live alon unblest die unblest alon
save brother monk held carv cross stone
In cold rigid clasp die eye wear
look mortal strive mortal agoni prayer

though last stiff finger drop cross
gleam distant citi swept face across
the clay lip settl calm thu monk attest
look one much peril enter rest

not thu younger brother seek master face
but earth lowli place strive step trace
wherev want grief besought clamor complaint
there beheld lord nake athirst faint

and hand wet tear wrung grate grasp
He lightli felt upon palm elder brother clasp
and loathsom couch woe want bent
low voic thrill soul So ye done unto Me

despis mystic tie blood yet claim
the broader wider brotherhood everi race name
To kin kind loyal truth yet still
hi mother brethren god

all littl one dear light paradis
seem fall pure innoc eye
the flower fring cool stream gem
dewi sod
To rapt vision seem like visibl smile god

the deep full heart throb unceas silent

To hear untransl psalm drew anoint ear
and listen lo heard god voic him near

the happi hum bee made summer silenc sweet
not lightli view grass beneath feet
It pave hi presencechamb walk happi guest
Ah slight veil truth life blest

and still twilight pass summer land

and wide eager eye smile stretch hand

As dearest friend welcom abod
etern silenc seal wondrou smile cri

but legend tell grave fell strang pure

that winer rose plant thereupon would spring white
hold mystic heal cool snow bloom lain
On ach brow sorrow heart would eas pain



rich man S reveri


the year go littl seem
like within dream
the year stood lure guis
beckon us paradis
To jailer turn time goe
guard fair land byandbi
where thought bliss rest
the sound whose forest balmi leav
sway dream wind strang sweet
We heard bed neath cottag eav
whose tower saw western sky
when eager eye tremul lip
We watch silent silver ship
Of crescent moon sail away
oer land would reach day day

but year flown weari feet
have never reach isl blest
but care felt ach breast
lifelong struggl grief unrest
that part boyish plan
and yet gold hous land
and laden vessel whitewing fleet
that fli bid across sea
and hat dof will hand
As tread villag street
but wealth fame
what thought would

turn wander back
with memori dusti track
Of year lie
To farmhous old brown
shade poplar duski green
paus gate beard man
but boy earnest eye

stand gate look around
At fresh fair world lie
the misti mountaintop aglow
with love sun pleasant ground
asleep feet sunni dream
Of milkwhit flower heart clear
the tall churchspir distanc gleam
point tranquil sky
blue roof seem near

and wood morn breez
come freight rich perfum
that myriad spici cup distil
loiter along oer locusttre
scatter plumtre bloom
In flake crimson snow
down gold daffodil
that border path

and silver thread rivulet
tangl knot fern sedg
and millpond like diamond set
In streamlet emerald edg
and stream gradual hill
it headston glimmer pale white
Is graveyard quiet still
wade grass rank deep
past slant marbl mossi dim
carven line old hymn
To one mother use lean
On sunday noon weep
that tall white shape look upon
with mysteri dread
link unto senseless stone
the imag dead
the father never seen
rememb dark night storm
when parlor bright warm
would turn away glow light
and look far churchyard dim
and infinit piti think
shut alon dismal night

and ruin mill waterfal
see crumbl wall
and hear water song
It come back
it song come back
float like spirit call
the drowsi air along
blend forev name
wonder propheci dreami talk
Of futur path walk
crown manhood honor fame

shut eye rich perfum
Of tropic lili fill room
from censer frost snow
but seem float night
from appleblossom red white
that star orchard fragrant gloom
those old bough hang low
where sister swing sway fro
through scent aisl air
while merri voic laugh rung
like bird answer brother shout
As shook bough oer curli head
till blossom fell rosi rain
On neck shine hair
Oh littl bell
Oh littl sister love well
It seem almost die
In lost time gay fair
and buri childhood sunni plain
and walk street today
Or gild carriag sweep town
stare humbler sister
with jewel gleam like lucent flame
proud grandeur fine array
Is stranger bear name

and littl boy play
hunt birdsnest shelter nook
trudg nightfal cow
explor barnloft ford brook
end schooltim puzzl brow
over small lesson book
who knelt side twilight dim
pray lord soul keep
then pillow fell asleep
hush mother even hymn
whose heart mine kept perfect time
such love cadenc tender rhyme
blent child grief perfect glee
We meet street clasp hand
and name charit paper stand
side side go bow
our two gray head prayer vow
In grand church hasti word
Of anger never bosom stir
yet whole wide world us
how broad deep gulf appear
between heart near

pleasur ground mansion grand
lowvoic servant come call
from senat name sound land
In aye nay solemnli read
they call honor gener
but tonight charley
charley want lay head
On mother heart rest
with soft hand press upon brow
cure weari pain
but never nevermor
for mould marbl rise
between head love breast
and death cruel power part
forev gone lost
that true tender heart

Oh mother ve never found love like thine
never eye look mine
with proud love perfect trust
never hand true kind
To lead path right

that head like bless lay
and led child guid youth
tonight t dreari thought truth
that gentl hand dust
that may blame sad
that may prais glad
T dreari thought boy tonight
that sweet smile brow

that never twilight fall

Of homestead far away

the homestead ruin gone decay
but read hous made hand
whose firm foundat forev stand
and twilight soft sweet
will stand outstretch hand
My homesick eye meet
To welcom boy day
To home rest forevermor

but year come year go
and lay grave silent pass
red summer bud wreath snow
and spring fade grass
and far away english town
In seclud tranquil shade
Of old cathedr quaint brown
anoth grave made
small grave yet high
It shadow world
and darken earth sky
but time pass
the unreason agoni
like cloud drop rain
and light shone heart last
and patienc born pain
and like breath heal balm
the sweet thought come
that child reach isl calm
over silent sea
that pure littl blanch safe truth
safe immort beauti youth

when left us twilight gloom
when left empti nest
and ach heart
full well full well know
what tenderey angel bent
down browney littl bird
from shine battlement
know fond caress
and love smile word
and look tender bless
she took breast
and led quiet room
In mansion blest
Oh mother belov oh child dear
not wish would lure

My son bright brave boy grace
Of beauti caught mother face
and mother truth dear

My heart bound wife child
but summer life may
and dream hope youth beguil

Of hair hue robin wing

He enter prayer tear

So call pain loss
We may alway count aright
the rough bar heavi cross

the deacon S daughter


the spareroom window wide rais
and could look summer day
On pastur green sunni hill
and low rill wander away

with rose caraway

upon couch drawn near light

fell mother weddingr
she smile father face
So drop earthli thing
My hand free hold flower
Of etern spring

Of way peac pleasant

No sweeter voic choir

the deacon straightback pew
had dream lost youth
and thought fairfac hebrew maid
Of rachel ruth

but fade day day

As nearer ear came
distant sea mysteri beat

upon paint porch without
two women stood whisper low
they thought d go day
they said deacon wife went

into land pure delight
and jordan roll

then knelt besid dead
hi white lock lit sunset flame
My god oh leav alon
but bless thi holi name
the golden gate lift
the king glori came

the coquett


how blame
Is fault fair
fashion featur
Or brush gold hair
becaus eye blue bright
must never look ground
but put eyelid snow light
lest foolish heart wound

how fault

He almost rous emot
that die innoc youth
emot live life new
ere man pathway cross
who play game untru
when stake love lost

Oh saintli beauti
what effort soul make
thought good puriti
were possibl sake
the world seem born anew life
such holi mean wore
fanci fair fond dream
never fell ruin

He toy fresh affect
As breath countri air
To refresh season
Of fashion falsehood glare
had slain tender
had life sweet
might known nobler happi
than humbl men feet

but love lure
To make slave gaze
like serf conqueror chariot
like moth candleblaz
melt royal time pearl
and quaff cup like queen
and forget dizzi tumult whirl
the woman might

the fisher S wife


long low wast yellow sand
lay shine northward far eye could reach
southward rocki bluff rose high
broken wild fantast shape
near one jag rock tower high
and oer water lean like giant grim
strive peer mysteri
the ocean whisper continu
and cover soft treacher face
for rest sun sink low
like great golden globe sea

In dizzi circl shrill cri
and plank float wreck
with shred musti seawe

the red light fade sung

she drew cloak still closer round child
and turn toward cabin
As went faint glow glimmer
In east slowli rose
the silver crescent moon
anoth paler light warm sunset glow
but clear enough guid home



the land OF long ago


now crimson light fade west
and twilight drop purpl shadow low
We stand memori mountain crest
that overlook land long ago

unmov still form besid us stand
while mourn tear heavi eye oerflow
As silent lift shadowi hand
and point us land long ago

It lie beauti neath sad eye rang
bath richer light warmer glow
for fairer moon sunset rare strang

So fair dear land long ago

We see gleam spire high hall
We garnish bright gem preciou show
No foot within gild doorway fall
empti room within long ago

troop white dove still haunt shine tower
and fold bliss calm wing snow
We bade build nest brighter bower
but still linger long ago

there sunni bay stand state ship
We freight fair land would go
still gleam gold within secret crypt
becalm besid shore long ago

between land dread doubt
the silent year drift trackless snow
hide pathway wander
forev land long ago



lemoin


In unquiet night
with beauti bright
she walketh silent chamber fro
not twice mind
sometim unkind unkind
and coo dove hath voic sweet low

such mad mirth lie
In haunt hazel eye
when melodi laugh charm listen night
it glamour old
My charm sens hold
forget earth heaven pleasur sens sight

with sudden gay capric
quaint sonnet doth seiz
wed unto sweet fall crimson lip
hold broider flower
Of enchant hour
when wound silk round white fingertip

then doth silent stand
lift slender hand
On gleam ring tore hand baywood
the tini opal heart
are broken two part
and rubi burn hangeth drop blood

then burn cheek
rais head speak
lemoin lemoin lost Oh speak pray
but word deign
adown shine lane
the long lustrou lane moonlight glide away

fanci oft stir
Of wing seem follow
trail terribl gloom along oaken floor
As walk fro
louder strang sound grow
To nameless dread horror flood chamber oer

and rais head
from terrorhaunt bed
and hush breath puls hush hark
but glanc around
the stir murmur sound
die away moonlight lie stiff stark



and thu ever flee
elud baffl
My ladi alway lightli glide away
though swiftest breez
you sail oer farthest sea
rememb side side two stand one day

though dust feed wind
your prayer consign
To keep churchyard seraph marbl saint
lemoin two shall meet
and feet
will fetter late repent wile tear plaint

repent strong
that would found tongu
and shriek truth heaven maddn din
the truth dread hour
that black accurs hour
when free hate fetter plung soul sin

whatev wise man think
sin forg strongest link
you break never although time may hide
buri flower wine
thi chain thine mine
At last dread day doom draw us side side

If one curs
and come best worst
forev ever fate mine entwin
and though mad mad
heaven know thought glad
breed thought help mind



So silent doth come
stand pale dumb
with finger laid lip warn way
her dark eye look back
As upon track
and mine phantom shape impend evil lay

but strive see
Of warn
cruelli calm sign deign love fear
unheed vow prayer
As noiseless air
she glideth pallid moonlight disappear



sleep


come softey sleep
with ermin sandal feet
press pain troubl brow
with kiss cool sweet
lull slumbrou song
song clime blest
while heavi eyelid
your dewi finger rest

come nativ flower
heartseas lotu bloom
enwrap weari sens
with cloud perfum
for whisper thought tire
their constant dull repeat
like low wave throb sob
with endless endless beat



the ladi maud


sit cloud dark
where lost peerless one
your bright face shine upon fairer land
like dawn sun
and rustic youth
you sometim smile upon

you roam mighti citi
By orient gleam sea
down glitter street venic
and softski arabi
life anthem
but solemn dirg

for everywher rome bright hill
Or silveri rhine
you win heart where
your glanc tress shine
but darl love mani
Is love like mine

last night heard voic dream
woke joyou thrill
To hear halfawaken bird
for dark dawn linger still
and lonesom sound water
At foot carey hill

Oh pine dark carey hill
and water black
but shone like wave jasper
upon one day know
the day bore stream
with face white snow

you lay like littl lamb arm
So frail thing weak
and coward lip said burn word
they never dare speak
If felt chill brow
and marbl cheek

life bitter gift
that fain would thrown away
but could thank god knee
for give life day
As took lie helpless
from gate death away

how nobl kinsmen laugh wept
oer treasur snatch flood
and whitefac brother brought gold

the stori OF gladi

To intrust land return

dear haunt sought daili maiden feet
and wilt thou sake thou shalt
To save thi sire shame wore day
and still promis though wept
At wild plead trembl rage

Of revrenc holi memori

dull paper appeas hungri law

No graybeard old dryer tome
tall fairfac youth bright bold gaze
and blood leap afresh like crimson wine
rash blood led leap oer gate
fivebar within mossi park upon
the knight old stumbl steed play fals
To harm lost life
more fortun youth though bruis
and bleed mani grievou wound
and gladi tend gentlest care
till love crept took place pain
and heart took piti weep place
and dwelt king He knew bride
Of heaven vex earthli love

and far away pure eye look adown

nay life long dream sleep last
until waken land love

thi stori father heard haughtili deni
the grass wave rankli give fellow lie
how mani secret tall deceit grass hide
pat turf cover maiden innoc rest
and creep wind old haunt ruin among
As silent smooth mould murder breast
smother deeper silenc buri wrong

In father galleri saw pictur face

No beauti long line nobl race
had eye softli bath bright bewitch bliss
you nineteen said paint spain
the year came foreign tour
By artist low reach disdain
delic passionateheart boy proud poor

So said rumor float us across sea
you invalid mother
fanci set heart pure feel free
for first time far proud old father care
for use wander shade garden way
your slight hand close clasp fairhair
english youth
hi blue eye bent blush face rumor say
though light bird trust much truth

your face face look antiqu frame

that pictur never paint gold fame
So vow artist friend went hall
but pain white brow sit regal ween

My slavish glanc crown love fate queen
As pass peerless beauti adown villag street

the south wind murmur tenderli
To complain leav
the flower queen gorgeou tapestri
Of rose purpl weav
ye natur smile wari
wear olden truth
but miss sunshin heart

squir perci S pride


the squir none common men
whose ancestor nobodi know

In line roman nose
that turn true patrician curv
In curl princ lip
In slightli insol eyelid
In point fingertip

veri erect grand look squir
As walk oer broad estat
for felt earth honor
In bear honor weight

Or gaze pillar portico
On faroutli land

In tini whitewash cottag

the poor man one littl lamb
yet envi rich man

poor garden yet rich withal
In priceless pearl girl
So perfect form faultless face
never brighten hall earl
her eye two fathomless star light
and shone squir day day
till warm peril splendor
So melt pride away

that fain would taken pretti pet lamb
To dwell state fold
To fetter fast jewel chain
and cage bar gold
but coy littl lamb love freedom
not free though true
but oh dainti shi littl lamb
well master voic knew

T vain squir stori tell
Of rich high descent
As fell one rosi shell ear
out mate went
how one grim old ancestor land
with william conqueror came
she thought sweet conqueror
she knew name

So tender conflict
the great man forc yield
To handsom sunburnt ploughman
who sow reap field
for vainli pour glitter gift
vainli plead besought
her heart tender soft littl heart
but heart bought

So strang thing warrant
happen everi day
that pride thriven centuri
one slight littl maiden slay
whi proud squir roman featur
quiver burn shame
and pictur grim ancestor
blush antiqu frame

were romanc idl tale
the squir would sicken die
slain pitiless cruelti
Of dark dazzl eye
and shadowi convent
would bow beauti head
but hand told penit bead
wore plain gold ring instead

and twice oak tree bloom
ere wed ladi grand
whose tall tower famili tree
had age darken land
T famou genealog tree
with modernli thrifti shoot
but tree sap royalti
encrust mossi old root

thi leaf pluck outmost twig
wa somewhat wither t true
long year flown sinc lightli danc
To summer air dew
not much dowri brought
In beauti vulgar pelf
but two three ancestor
more squir

T much muse oer musti name
and think children brain
should move sanguin current
that flown ancient vein
but think sometim secret heart
the squir breath woeful sigh
for fresh sweet face littl maid
with dark wonder eye

but bird ever sang song
To mate content nest
As wee wait wife twilight
wa tread gloriou west
As look cluster rose
for manli form would come
Up cool green even field
To sweet littl wife home

she could see great stone mansion
tower oak dark green
and lawn like emerald velvet
fit feet queen
but round browney princess
did love ermin fold
queen richer realm
she dearer wealth gold

On face pure innoc face sweet

Of childhood home oft home dead
Of grave went alon night wed
and knelt pure cheek press marbl cold

It sin said eye darkest blue

she could love dead still live true

she could think one love best
Of true world deceiv
who felt grief griev
and share joy thrill girlish breast

It sin heard voic gentl deep
and echo name cut marbl
So sin said breath low
In midnight hour asleep

but wearier grew pride pomp like home sick child

and paler grew cheek worn wear pain
she said fresh free countri air would seem sweet

Oh sybil sweet littl sybil

At cannon dread sound

and song northern brook

To death oh bravest saddest sight

To battl gori gain

No never

such nobl boy harri

summer bring wealth flower
flower everi form color
orang crimson royal purpl
all along mountain pass
all along pleasant valley
low emerald branch bendeth
with weight summer glori

but waken us
half tender bliss feel
half pure sweet emot
As first springflow april
with lash ting crimson
partli rais eye halftimid
fear snow drown
how love dainti blossom
how wear bosom

just tree ancestr
mani flower may blossom
but first wee bud graft
To heart ah love
other may love fondli
but love proudli
love blindli entir

ye first heart door open
To touch babi finger
quick dimpl feet bear
To dearest place warmest
plenti room enough
bud beauti bud promis
In heart capaci chamber
but first firmli settl
littl harri firmli settl
In centr affect
later one must settl round



the crimin S betroth


As waveless sea vessel strike
upon treacher rock
wake sailor happi dream
By swift terribl shock

dream shade villag street home
forget cruel sea
till shock came woke yet know
T love love

T star wave wildli clasp
onli form reflect stream
T broken heart mourn
onli broken dream

die brought low

die cling blast oak
the ivi cling unmov

T love look strang sweet eye

hi lowton voic smile
Oh soul patient sever
but yet littl

befor put away outward form
deceiv sweet disguis love wore
let heart break regret tear

just fond friend watch fade sail
bear away guest truest worth
they give littl time grief
return desol hearth

and build new fire gather dewi flower
let pure air vacant room
So light bloom sweet
shall penetr gloom

patient littl time
quiet full rest
god peac come like softwing bird
settl upon breast

not alway thu shall beat restless heart
like wild eagl gainst prisonbar
In calm twilight futur time
sit calmbrow underneath star

smooth hair
silken wave sunni brown
lay upon white brow

My heart sing like bird tonight
that fli nest soft twilight
and sing brood bliss
Ah low high
what could find love cri
did ever love stoop low

As miser jealous count gold

from curiou world apart
too sacr joy anoth eye

that ever queenli forehead shone
Is kiss left brow
would chang smile royal gem
hi love monarch diadem

My heart sing like bird tonight
that fli away nest light
To brood oer live bliss
Ah low high
what could find love cri
did ever love stoop low

when enwrap rosi pleasur
our careless puls beat
with rhythm sweet sweet
To music merri measur

when world wave rise around us
with soft transpar weight
light seem yet great
the liquid chain bound us

then softli downward fall
If listen hear
from purer atmospher
warn call

T utter ear
To spirit spoken
In wonder unbroken
heavenli speech spirit hear

strang solemn doth roll
downward like yearn cri
from belfri far high
warn call soul

ever ever doth roll
our angel guard tower
ring ring everi hour

geniev TO her lover


turn key idl hour
Of ivori box look lo
see dust dust flower
the water ebb water flow
and dream come dream go
forev

Oh friend meet
beneath bough bend lime
should low voic repeat
the tender word old love rhyme
It could bring back old time
never

when laid rose brow
quit unus way men
with trust heart wiser
So smile rememb heartthrob
the dust rose blossom
never

the brow prais colder grown
and heart chang suppos must
rose last blossom stone
ash ash dust dust
dead rose love trust

the wild rose


In wast yellow sand brow dreari hill
slight littl slip rose struggl light
the seed mayb sown south wind idl
but grew blossom pale white
onli one flower bore frail small
but think brave tri grow

In grove fair cashmer shelter garden king
sweet thousand flower bird paradis
fan blush cheek glow wing
prais deepen bloom great bright eye
life would pleasur instead toil
To pale littl patient rose sandi soil

did ever sadli think wast life
fold wan weak hand helpless still
and great oak shelter glad bird life
and thirsti meadow prais run rill
she could hear happi workday song busi brook
while poor thing could stand look

did wee white rose ever think lone life
that none care tri grow
none care cloud hung west
should burst scatter pale leav far low
did ever wish heavi cloud would fall
and hide unblest sight

one sky bend oer rich garden flower
that dwell barren soil untend unblest
and think god pleas small white rose
that tri patient live best
that brave kept small leav pure fair
On wast dreari sand desert air



our bird


she lay asleep face shone white
As snowi veil
and waxen hand clasp breast
were full snowdrop pale
but holi calm touch babi lip
the brow sleep eye
the look angel piti us
from peac paradis

and though lie neath coffinlid
We think dead
but think delic bird
To milder countri fled
T long dark flight gentl dove
our bird tender fair
but know reach summer land
and fold white wing



the time that IS TO BE


think fern forest tower stand
crown barren mountain shade dreari land

Oh dread quiet brood solitud sublim
that reign like shadowi spectr oer third
great day time

In long low line tideless sea dull gray shore break
No song bird gleam wing oer wood reedi lake

No flower perfum pulseless air star moon sun
To tell silver languag night past day done

onli silenc rise ghostli morn misti light
silenc silenc settl upon moonless starless night

and fern giant moss noiseless sentinel stand
look oer tideless ocean watch oer dreari land

fern gave place glow oliv cluster drop wine
moss chang oaken tissu cleft fragrant pine

deft noiseless finger toil wrought great
creator plan
through countless age mould earth abod man

till imperi day bound sunset crimson bar
the purpl column night crown shine star

the ripe fruit seek sunlight cluster leav
the earth deck golden maiz costli yellow sheav

countless silent centuri pass fashion good
doth appear
shall weari grow hopeless wait golden year



thi kingdom come thi done
from myriad soul rise yearn cri
scatter palmbough behold brighter sun
shall dawn splendor clearer sky
upon distant hill glow see
that tell us time

the desert shall blossom like rose
the almond flourish rocki slope
wisdom beauti rare union close
make earth beauti beyond hope
high duski east star see
herald time

the freeborn soul shall captiv
bound decay cord narrow creed
god imag shall clearli shine men
divin shape holi aim deed
gleam golden star oh gleam oer earth sea
herald time

fetter broken fernleav fall
richer growth bud wondrou fair
the flower liberti shall bloom
and shall breath heal air
the bless air wrap peopl free
within gloriou time

for slaveri woe crime
and freedom liberti
Oh perfect hour ye come fair sublim
bear sweet form babi peac
shine golden star oh shine oer earth sea
herald time
