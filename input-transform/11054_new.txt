AN
american tale

Ah piti pang feel
If piti eer ye knew
An age father wound heal
thro scene death flew

perhap hastn step vain
perhap warrior die
yet let sooth part pain
yet lead lie

thu listn band call
nor fruitless desir
they lead pant wall
that hold captiv sire

and daughter come bless
these age eye
thi father pain less
hi pain oer

My father wain lamp

those tear father ill bear
He live child thee
gentl youth piti care
ha lent aid

born western world hand
maintain hostil caus
and fierc britannia band
hi er sword draw

yet feel captiv briton woe
for ennobl mind
forget name britain foe
In love human kind

yet know child dearer tie
ha link d heart mine
He mourn friendship holi sigh
the youth belov d thine

but hark welcom feet near
thi rise grief suppress
By dark veil d hasten

Oh heaven edward breast

that give tortur d bosom rest
He sure would bless thee

Oh tell lover fell

hi last dear accent stranger tell
Oh hast tell

that set spirit free
say rais close eye
As sought

ask father cri d know

nor think child tale woe

tho everi joy edward fled
when edward friend near
It sooth break heart said
To tell joy dear

when wind still
mild beam morn break
when first light hill

So calm unruffl soul
where rude passion strove
So mild sooth accent stole
upon ear love

where dear illus fled
which sooth d former hour
where path fanci spread
Ah vainli spread flower

heard battl fear sound
they seem d lover knell
heard pierc d ghastli wound
My ventrou lover fell

My sorrow shall life endur
for lov d gone
but someth tell heart sure
My life long

My pant soul bear

sonnet

To mrs bate


Oh thou whose melodi heart obey
thou canst subject passion move
whose note heav n listn soul rais
can thrill piti melt love
happi natur lent nativ charm
whose melt tone shed magic power
sweeter pleasur oer social hour
the breast soft sooth virtu warm but
yet happi thi life clear
from discord thi perfect cadenc flow
that tun d sympathi thi faith tear
In mild accord fall other woe
that tender pure affect bind
In chain harmoni thi will mind



sonnet

To twilight


meek twilight soften declin day
and bring hour pensiv spirit love
when oer mountain flow descend ray
that give silenc desert grove
Ah let happi court morn still
when bloom loveli array d
she bid fresh beauti light vale hill
and raptur warbl vocal shade
sweet odour morn flower
and rich melodi accent rise
yet dearer soul shadowi hour
At blossom close music die
for languid natur droop head

TO
sensibl


In sensibilitys lov d prais
tune trembl reed
and seek deck shrine bay
On heart must bleed

No cold exempt pain
ever wish d know
cheer d transport sustain
without complaint woe

abov whate content give
abov charm eas
the restless hope fear live
with power pleas

where friendship power
To heal wound heart
To shorten sorrow lingr hour
and bid gloom depart

T light melt eye
with look anguish dear
she know price evri sigh

Of everi finer bliss sourc

the softer grace boundless forc
confid passion know

when anoth fond breast
each thought ever give
when anoth lean rest
and anoth live

quick trembl metal fli
when heat cold impel
her anxiou heart joy rise
Or sink anguish dwell

yet tho soul must grief sustain
which alon know
and feel keener sens pain
which sharpen everi woe

tho mourner grief calm
still share pang feel
and like tree distil balm
bleed other wound heal

while whose bosom fondli true
ha never wish d rang
one alter d look trembl view
and scarc bear chang

tho death band tear
she vainli thought secur
thro life must languish despair
that never hope cure

tho wound vulgar mind
unconsci deed
who never seek wound bind
but wonder bleed

she oft heav secret sigh
will shed lone tear
oer feel natur wrought high
and gave term dear

yet would hard indiffer choos
whose breast tear steep
who apathi would lose
the sacr power weep

tho thousand object pain
and pleasur trembl nigh
those object strive reach vain
the circl eye

cold fabl god appear
To poor suppliant grief
who bath marbl form tear
and vainli hope relief

Ah grevil  gift refus
To soul like thine alli
No thi natur seem lose
No thi soft hide

No invok play sprite
To chill magic spell
the tender feel delight
and anguish sung well

that envi eas thi heart would prove
were sure dearli bought
with friendship sympathi love
and everi finer thought



song




No rich scanti store
My lover could impart
He gave boon valu
He gave heart




hi soul sincer genrou worth
might well bosom move
and ask d bliss earth
meant love




but search gain
from shore shore fli
whi wander rich obtain
when love prize




the frugal meal lowli cot
If blest love thee
that simpl fare humbl lot
were wealth




while dangrou ocean brave
My tear vainli flow
Is piti faithless wave
To pour woe




the night dark water deep
yet soft billow roll
ala everi breez weep
the storm soul



AN
ode
ON the
peac




As wandr late albion shore
that chain rude tempestu deep
heard hollow surg roar
and vainli beat guardian steep
heard rise sound woe
loud storm wild pinion flow
and still vibrat mourn lyre
that tune grief sympathet wire




from shore wide atlant lave
the spirit ocean bear
In moan along western wave
afflict natur hopeless care
enchant scene young delight
how chang d sinc first ye rose sight
sinc first ye rose infant glori drest
fresh wave rear d ampl breast




her crest serpent discord throw
oer scene love rose grac d
the flowri chain hand compos
she wildli scatter oer wast
her glanc play smile deform
her frantic voic awak storm
from land land torch spread fire
while love pure flame stream blood expir




now burn savag soul war
while terror flash eye
Lo wave oer fieri car
aloft bloodi banner fli
the battl wake aw sound
He thunder oer echo ground
He grasp reek blade stream blood
ting vast plain swell purpl flood




but softer sound sorrow flow
On droop wing murmr gale
have born deep complaint woe
that rose along lone vale
those breez waft orphan cri
they trembl parent sigh
and drink tear keener anguish shed
the tear faith love hope fled




the object anxiou fear
lie pale earth expir cold
ere wing d happi love one year
too rapid cours roll d
In vain die hand grasp
hang quivr lip clasp
the faint form slowli sink death
To catch part glanc fleet breath




pale livid cors cheek
her tress torn glanc wild
how fear frantic shriek
she wept horror smil d
she gaze wild affright
Lo bleed phantom rush sight
hark yon mangl form mourner call
then earth senseless weight fall




and see oer gentl andr tomb
the victim despair
who fell life exult bloom
nor deem d life deserv d care
oer cold earth relick prest
Lo britain droop legion rest
for sword sternli grasp appear
dim sigh sulli tear


IX

while seward sweep plaintiv string
while pensiv round sabl shrine
radiant zone grace fling
where full emblaz d virtu shine
the mourn love trembl nigh
shall catch warm melodi sigh
the mourn love shall drink tear flow
from piti hovr soul dissolv d woe




and hark albion flowri vale
parent deep complaint hear
sister call western gale
To waft soulexpress tear
T asgil claim pierc sigh
that drop dim beauteou eye
while rack doubt affect prove
how strong forc bind tie love


XI

how oft everi dawn grace
that blossom d earli hour
her soul comfort lov d trace
and deck d futur flower
but lo fanci troubl sight
the dear illus sink night
she view murder d form quivr breath
the rise virtu chill d shade death


xii

ceas ceas ye throb hopeless woe
He live futur hour bless
He live purest joy know
parent transport fond excess
hi sight father eye shall chear
sister droop charm endear
the privat pang albion genrou care
for breath d warm accept prayer


xiii

and lo radiant stream light
defend gild murki cloud
where desol gloomi night
retir fold sabl shroud
It flash oer brightn deep
It soften britain frown steep
T mild benign peac enchant form
that gild black abyss lull storm


xiv

So thro dark impend sky
where cloud fallen vapour roll d
their curl wreath dissolv fli
As faint hue light unfold
the air spread azur stream
the sun dart orient beam
and mountain glow wood bright
while natur hail season delight


XV

and bind realm flowri band

and thi soft call awak strain love


xvi

bless ye power patriot name
that court fair peac thi gentl stay
Ah gild glori light fame
and glad life pleasur ray
while like th affright dove thi form
still shrink fear latent storm
hi care shall sooth thi pant soul rest
and spread thi vernal couch albion breast


xvii

Ye mourn d part hour
which love darker horror drew
Ye vainli tri pour
with faltr voic last adieu
when pale cheek burst sigh
the soul hovr eye
express d pain felt pain fear d
Ah paint youth return grief endear d


xviii

yon hoari form aspect mild
desert kneel anguish prest
and seek heav n longlost child
To smooth path lead rest
He come close sink eye
To catch faint expir sigh
moment transport stay fleet breath
and sooth soul pale verg death


xix

No sanguin wreath shall twine
On lost hero earli tomb
but hung around thi simpl shrine
fair peac shall milder glori bloom
Lo commerc lift droop head
triumphal thame thi deep bed
and bear albion sail sublim
the rich natur give happier clime


XX

she fearless print polar snow
mid horror reject day
along burn line glow
nor shrink beneath torrid ray
she open india glittr mine
where stream light reflect shine
waft bright gem britain temprat vale
and breath odour northern gale


xxi

while fardivid shore
where liberti unconqu d rove
her ardent glanc shall oft explor
the parent isl spirit love
shall spread upon western main
harmoni concord golden chain
while stern gallia ever hostil strand
from albion cliff pour dare band


xxii

yet hide sabr hideou glare
whose edg bath d stream blood
the lanc quiver high air
and fall drink purpl flood
for britain fear shall seiz thi foe
while freedom thi senat glow
while peac shall smile upon thi cultur d plain

On soft bosom love rest
while discord sound expir

the fine vibrat spirit move
and touch spring raptur love

Lo mid dark deep void space

the spinster knitter sun
and free maid weav thread bone
Do use chant It silli sooth
and dalli innoc love
like old age
shakspear S twelfth night



edwin and eltruda

legendari tale


where pure derwent water glide
along mossi bed
close river verdant side
castl rear d head

the ancient pile time raz d
where gothic trophi frown d
where gild armour blaz d
and banner wav d around

there liv d chief well known fame
bold adventr knight
renown d victori name
In glori annal bright

what time martial pomp led
hi gallant chosen train
the foe oft conquer d fled
indign fled plain

yet milder virtu possest
and gentler passion felt
for calm yield breast
the soft affect dwelt

No rug toil heart could steel
By natur form d prove
whate tender mind feel
In friendship love

He lost partner breast
who sooth d rise care
and ever charm d pain rest
she ever lov d share

from solitud hop d relief
and lone mansion sought
To cherish faith grief
To nurs tender thought

there bosom fondli dear
An infant daughter smil d
and oft mourner fall tear
bedew d emma child

the tear oer babe hung
would trembl eye
while bless faltr tongu
were breath d sigh

tho time could never heal wound
It sooth d hopeless pain
and child thought found
hi emma liv d

soft dew morn aris
and pale flower gleam
So soft eltruda melt eye
with love piti beam

As drest charm lone flower
smile desert vale
with beauti gild morn hour
and scent even gale

So liv d solitud unseen
thi love peerless maid
So grac d wild sequest d scene

To leav noisi crowd bless

the sordid view engag
the mercenari pair

whom rich unit part
To still unknown

they littl knew wealth power
To make constant rove
they littl knew weighti dower
could add one bliss love

and bleat mother lead
the lamb chanc d stray

for brui d insect wast

and oft care hand replac d

To sensat calm

On pale cheek hung tear
Of agon woe

Of golden age past

mean giddi height climb
and vainli toil sublim
while everi line labour wrought
Is swell d trope want thought
nor shall call muse shed
castalian drop upon head
Or send parnassian bower
chaplet wove fanci flower
At present aid slight
My heart instruct write

that softer glide hour along
that still grief sooth d song
that still careless number flow
To success skill owe
you sick oer hung
and languor lyre unstrung
with treasur heal art
with friendship ardor heart
from sick snatch d earli prey
and bade fair health goddess gay
with sprightli air win grace
with laugh eye rosi face

On light pinion hasten near
and swift restor influenc kind
My weaken d frame droop mind

To stop fruitless hopeless tear

To charm fanci power vein

bid dryad peopl bower

Ah vain path trac d

In light frenchman plea d see

whose careless hour glide smooth along
who charm misfortun song

her lake whose broad bosom thrown
rush loud impetu rhone
and bear wave mazi sweep
In rapid torrent deep
Oh muse less weak wing
high yon alpin steep spring
and tell vers disclos
As well told prose
how wrapt snow ici shower
etern winter horrid lower
upon mountain aw brow
while purpl summer bloom
how ici structur rear form
pale product ten thousand storm
where full sunbeam powerless fall
On crystal arch column wall
yet paint proud fantast height
with variou hue light
whi poet call d birth
In favour d spot earth
how high ventrou muse might rise
and proudli scorn ask suppli
from parnassian hill fire
Of vers mont blanc might well inspir
O switzerland oft eye
desir view thi mountain rise
how fanci love thi steep climb
So wild solemn sublim
and oer thi happi vale roam
where freedom rear humbl home
Ah unlik social grace
which bind love thi manli race
the holland phlegmat eas
too cold love dull pleas
who feel sympathet woe
nor sympathet joy bestow
but fanci word made
To serv purpos trade
and neither buy sell

now happiest light seen
voltair even cha d spleen
and plac d supper friend

Of name renown d clearli shew

To prussia martial clime stray
and see freder spend day

To form troop futur fight
thro firm rank glanc pierc
where disciplin aspect fierc

My femal heart delight turn
where great seem quit stern

and live soften human woe

but lo ocean stormi breast

while round spire billow rave

where classic Po devolv tide

An exil earli bloom
and bore rack unmov d

the lord earth drag chain

No longer yield heroic worth

Or consecr medal rust

the dire arenas horrid stage
Is banish d milder age

At human feel bled

while virgils tomb bend
O let step attend

and kiss lip devout ground

In drydens tune line pierc

O art benign light

Or one drear void sadden d life

while travel want skill
To mark shape good ill
with vacant stare thro europ rang
and deem bad t strang

and thro everi vain disguis

while intellectu object share

So path life tread

with whose pure radianc glori blend ray
whom fame circl fairest wreath

To rend veil obscur spread
where lone sigh desert geniu draw

To lead droop spirit thi fane
where attic joy social circl warm

where wit wisdom blend seprat charm

To bid vigrou tide geniu roll

the littl triumph proud grace
for deed like purer incens spring
warm swell heart sourc trace

yet foster rich gift mind

while pleasur lucid star illum thi bower
thi piti view distant storm bend
where want unshelt d wast lingr hour
and meet bless heav n ascend

On exult lip thi name shall breath
while woman point thi finish d page

and oer lowhung tempest lift soul

Or hang sombrou rock deeper gloom

Or soar view comet fieri frame
rush oer sky fold sphere flame
while charm d spirit accent move
Is wrapt wonder dissolv d love

At length almagro alphonso train

the sound frantic woe pant hear
where anguish dim mother eye tear
Or maid gave love soft power

and ah till death shall eas tender woe
that soul must languish tear must flow
for never thrill raptur prove

and morn glitter d oer field blood
where bath d gore peruvia vanquish d train

euphelia

AN
elegi

As roam d pilgrim oer mountain drear
On whose lone verg foam billow roar
the wail hopeless sorrow pierc d ear
and swell d distanc sound shore

the mourner breath d deep complaint night
her moan mingl rapid blast
that bar d bosom wast flight
and oer earth scatter d tress cast

Ye wind cri still heav labr deep
the mountain shake howl forest rend
still dash shivr fragment steep
nor wretch like storm suspend

Ah wherefor wish rise storm spare
Ah implor rage wind save
what refug breast live despair
desir death shelter grave

To congeni gloom night
the savag howl infest air
unappal d view fatal light
that flash point lightn glare

and yet erewhil night shadow threw
oer known woodland nativ vale
fanci vision wild landscap drew
and swell bode sound whispr gale

but deep despair arm d timid soul
and agoni numb d throb fear
taught weak heart terror controul
and court shun danger near

yet could welcom return light
it glimr beam might guid search eye
the sacr spot might emerg night
On lover bleed relick lie

for sure t late shepherd stray d
bewild d oer mountain dreari bound
close point cliff saw laid
where heav d water deep around

ala longer could heart endur
the woe heart doom d prove
He sought death death cure
that fate give vain hopeless love

My sire unjust passion swell d breast
from lov d alfr euphelia tore
mock d keen sorrow soul opprest
and bade vainli bade love

He told love like yon troubl deep
whose restless billow never know repos
are wildli dash d upon rocki steep
and trembl lightest breez blow

from rude storm remot gentl balm
dear suffr spirit peac appli
peac t th oblivi lake detest calm
whose dull slow water never fall rise

Ah avail parent stern command
the forc conqr passion subdu
and wherefor seek rend cruel hand
the tie enchant love fondli drew

yet could see alfr fix d despair
and aw d filial fear conceal woe
My coward heart cou d separ bear
and check struggl anguish rose

T guilt barbrou mandat obey
which bade part sigh bosom move
victim duti unrel sway
seem traitor slave love

let seal d lover fate endur
the sharpest pressur deserv d distress
twere ad perfidi seek cure
and stain d falsehood wish suffer less

for wretch doom d grief pine
oft benign hope ray impart
and piti oft celesti shrine
drop warm tear upon faint heart

but oer last gloom love despair
can hope bright ray cheer vision shed
can piti sooth woe breast must bear
which vainli love vainli mourn dead

No lingr still still prolong d moan
shall never paus till heav latest breath
till memori distract pang flown
and sorrow shall hush d death

and death piti come whose hand shall tear
from afflict heart sens pain
My faint limb refus load bear
and life longer form sustain

yet health enlivn glow adorn
and pleasur shed loveliest ray
pure gentl star gild morn
and constant equal light day

now lost pleasur trac d memori seem
like yon illus meteor glanc light
that oer dark threw instant gleam
then sunk vanish d depth night

My nativ vale thou delight bower
scene hopeless love ever dear
sweet vale morn wak d flow r
gay bower even pour d tear

ask see beauti rise
Ye rock mountain whose rug breast
My alfr murder d euphelia lie
In your deep solitud oh let rest

and sure dawn ray light steep
and slowli wander oer purpl wave
will shew sacr relic sleep
will lead mourner destin d grave

oer high precipic unmov d bent
fear path beam morn shew
the pilgrim reach d toil rude ascent
and saw brood oer deep

euphelia stay cri thi alfr call
Oh stay love sorrow yet dear
come In vain sooth accent fall
ala reach d distract ear

Ah avail said morn rose
with fruitless pain seek mouldr clay
vain search fill measur woe
the foam surg wash d cors away

thi cruel agoni longer bear
death death alon pang remov
kind death banish heart despair
and live live love

she said plung d aw deep
He saw meet furi wave
He frantic saw dart steep
with desprat anguish sought watri grave

He clasp d die form shar d sigh
He check d billow rush breast
she felt dear embrac close eye
were fix d alfr death blest

and beauti wake thee touch grace
but fright glanc thi form avert
when horror check thi tear thi struggl sigh
when frenzi roll thi impass d eye
Or guilt sit heavi thi labr heart
nor ever let shuddr fanci bear
the wast groan view pallid look
Of muse lov d hope forsook
hi spirit vainli muse dear
for charm d heavnli song bleed breast
mourn blest power vers could give despair rest
