far futur year may reach
and wake spell neer broken
star gleam memori sky

smile offer shrine
Or tear spring shall flow

rememb As one one
the cherish tie earth torn
the magic spell memori weav

MY niec


know darl littl girl
with silki chestnut hair
which fall mani danc curl
around shoulder fair

her eye dark soft
and round curtain bed
ve seen fairi smile full oft
their radiant beauti shed

her tear like rain
which fall summer hour
quick turn glitter gem
As sun succe shower

thi witch child small
her feebl tini hand
can scarc tend mammoth doll
which much care demand

then though voic sweet
she littl
than simpl childish song repeat
and prattl babi lore

she skip ah lame
one soft white foot deni
it aid bodi sustain
and weak powerless lie

yet strang say crown wear
which claim homag mute
and hand sceptr bear
whose sway neer disput

from whenc doth come wondrou power
she never fail wield
make strong heart will hour
To her light wish yield

If touch grief appear
To veil bright pure face
If sick cast shadow
Or pain dark line trace

how anxiou everi mean take
the ill drive away
and cheer dear sake
would watch night day

and light come health
brighten clear dark eye
what joy priceless wealth
earth gold never buy

she make us cast asid book
though fill learn rare
To work vain fun arch look
those beam featur wear

whenc spell think
that sweet childhood hour
eer yet soul learn drink
from knowledg fount power

Or felt virtu known
life sin yet begun
Or seen thick life path strown
with danger must shun

spirit pure doth come dwell
In freshburst mind
who weav round power spell
our heart firmli bind

our holier thought wake
our earthdim vision clear
and their puriti make
all holi thing dear

If speed spirit
the soul gather strength
the child becom busi men
busi man length

where our childhood spirit gone
how we lost charm
thu thrown around life earli morn
keep us safe harm

Ay whither speed rather say
Is alway
though dust life noonday
We may see nigh

nor dark cloud sin would veil
all glori sight
and make heart hope fail
and bright turn night

but midst virtu clearer air
the eye hindranc know
how radiant stand angel
what holi gift bestow

My darl niec whose form grace
ha made thought aris
m sure angel oft trace
In clear depth thine eye

and burst forth full heart
My prayer heaven ascend
that earth dark chang neer may part
thee thi angel friend

that puriti may alway

TO alberta


and thou art gone alberta
No sound shall wake thee
the dreamless sleep thou sleepest
death shadow thi brow

like bright summer flower
born rude wind away
whose odor yet shall linger
though fair form decay

So long thi spirit waft
In fragranc back earth
shall bloom memori bower
mid plant heavenli birth

We tune harp sad
and song sorrow sing
and father altar
mourn tribut bring

No thou strowest flower
Of sunshin oer path
thi song forev silent
thi voic hush death

yet thee sorrow
