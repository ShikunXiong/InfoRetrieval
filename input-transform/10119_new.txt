adonai





weep adonai dead
Oh weep adonai though tear
thaw frost bind dear head
and thou sad hour select year
To mourn loss rous thi obscur compeer
and teach thine sorrow say with
die adonai till futur dare
forget past fate fame shall
An echo light unto etern




where wert thou mighti mother lay
when thi son lay pierc shaft fli
In dark where lorn urania
when adonai die with veil eye
mid listen echo paradis
she sate one soft enamour breath
rekindl fade melodi
with like flower mock cors beneath
He adorn hid come bulk death



Oh weep adonai dead
wake melancholi mother wake weep
yet wherefor quench within burn bed
thi fieri tear let thi loud heart keep
like mute uncomplain sleep
for gone thing wise fair
descend Oh dream amor deep
will yet restor vital air
death feed mute voic laugh despair




most music mourner weep
lament anew urania He die
who sire immort strain
blind old lone countri pride
the priest slave liberticid
trampl mock mani loath rite
Of lust blood He went unterrifi
into gulf death clear sprite
yet reign oer earth third among son light




most music mourner weep anew
not bright station dare climb
and happier happi knew
whose taper yet burn night time
In sun perish other sublim
struck enviou wrath man god
have sunk extinct refulg prime
and yet live tread thorni road
which lead toil hate fame seren abod



but thi youngest dearest one perish
the nursl thi widowhood grew
like pale flower sad maiden cherish
and fed true love tear instead dew
most music mourner weep anew
thi extrem hope loveliest last
the bloom whose petal nipt blew
die promis fruit wast
the broken lili lie storm overpast




To high capit kingli death
keep pale court beauti decay
He came bought price purest breath
grave among eternal come away
hast vault blue italian day
Is yet fit charnelroof still
He lie dewi sleep lay
awak sure take fill
Of deep liquid rest forget ill




He awak oh never
within twilight chamber spread apac
the shadow white death door
invis corrupt wait trace
hi extrem way dim dwellingplac
the etern hunger sit piti awe
sooth pale rage dare defac
So fair prey till dark law
Of chang shall oer sleep mortal curtain draw



Oh weep adonai the quick dream
the passionwing minist thought
who flock near live stream
Of young spirit fed taught
the love music wander
wander kindl brain brain
but droop whenc sprung mourn lot
round cold heart sweet pain
they neer gather strength find home




and one trembl hand clasp cold head
and fan moonlight wing cri
our love hope sorrow dead
see silken fring faint eye
like dew upon sleep flower lie
tear dream loosen brain
lost angel ruin paradis
she knew t stain
she fade like cloud outwept rain




one lucid urn starri dew
wash light limb embalm
anoth dipt profus lock threw
the wreath upon like anadem
which frozen tear instead pearl begem
anoth wil grief would break
her bow wing reed stem
greater loss one weak
and dull barb fire frozen cheek




anoth splendour mouth alit
that mouth whenc wont draw breath
which gave strength pierc guard wit
and pass pant heart beneath
with lightn music damp death
quench caress upon ici lip
and die meteor stain wreath
Of moonlight vapour cold night clip
It flush pale limb pass eclips




and other came desir ador
wing persuas veil destini
splendour gloom glimmer incarn
Of hope fear twilight phantasi
and sorrow famili sigh
and pleasur blind tear led gleam
Of die smile instead eye
came slow pomp move pomp might seem
like pageantri mist autumn stream




all love mould thought
from shape hue odour sweet sound
lament adonai morn sought
her eastern watchtow hair unbound
wet tear adorn ground
dim aerial eye kindl day
afar melancholi thunder moan
pale ocean unquiet slumber lay
and wild wind flew round sob dismay




lost echo sit amid voiceless mountain
and feed grief rememb lay
and repli wind fountain
Or amor bird perch young green spray
Or herdsman horn bell close day
sinc mimic lip dear
than whose disdain pine away
into shadow sound drear
murmur song woodmen hear




grief made young spring wild threw
her kindl bud autumn
Or dead leav sinc delight flown
for wake sullen year
To phoebu hyacinth dear
nor narcissu
thou adonai wan stand sere
amid faint companion youth
with dew turn tear odour sigh ruth




thi spirit sister lorn nightingal
mourn mate melodi pain
not eagl like thee could scale
heaven could nourish sun domain
her mighti young morn doth complain
soar scream round empti nest
As albion wail thee curs cain
light head pierc thi innoc breast
and scare angel soul earthli guest




Ah woe winter come gone
but grief return revolv year
the air stream renew joyou tone
the ant bee swallow reappear
fresh leav flower deck dead season bier
the amor bird pair everi brake
and build mossi home field brere
and green lizard golden snake
like unimprison flame tranc awak




through wood stream field hill ocean
quicken life earth heart burst
As ever done chang motion
from great morn world first
god dawn chao In steam immers
the lamp heaven flash softer light
all baser thing pant life sacr thirst
diffus spend love delight
the beauti joy renew might




the leprou corps touch spirit tender
exhal flower gentl breath
like incarn star splendour
Is chang fragranc illumin death
and mock merri worm wake beneath
nought know die shall alon know
Be sword consum sheath
By sightless lightn Th intens atom glow
moment quench cold repos




ala love
but grief
and grief mortal woe
whenc scene
the actor spectat great mean
meet mass death lend life must borrow
As long sky blue field green
even must usher night night urg morrow
month follow month woe year wake year sorrow




he awak oh never
wake thou cri miseri childless mother rise
out thi sleep slake thi heart core
wound fierc tear sigh
and dream watch urania eye
and echo sister song
had held holi silenc cri aris
swift thought snake memori stung
from ambrosi rest fade splendour sprung




she rose like autumn night spring
out east follow wild drear
the golden day etern wing
even ghost abandon bier
had left earth corps sorrow fear
So struck rous rapt urania
So sadden round like atmospher
Of stormi mist swept way
even mourn place adonai lay




out secret paradis sped
through camp citi rough stone steel
and human heart aeri tread
yield wound invis
palm tender feet where fell
and barb tongu thought sharp
rent soft form never could repel
whose sacr blood like young tear may
pave etern flower undeserv way




In deathchamb moment death

blush annihil breath
revisit lip life pale light
flash limb late dear delight
leav wild drear comfortless
As silent lightn leav starless night
leav cri urania her distress
rous death death rose smile met vain caress




stay yet awhil speak
kiss long kiss may live
and heartless breast burn brain
that word kiss shall thought els surviv
with food saddest memori kept aliv
now thou art dead part
Of thee adonai would give
all thou art
but chain time thenc depart




O gentl child beauti thou wert
whi didst thou leav trodden path men
too soon weak hand though mighti heart
dare unpastur dragon den
defenceless thou wert oh
wisdom mirror shield scorn spear
Or hadst thou wait full cycl
thi spirit fill crescent sphere
the monster life wast fled thee like deer




the herd wolv bold pursu
the obscen raven clamor oer dead
the vultur conqueror banner true
who feed desol first fed
and whose wing rain contagion fled
when like apollo golden bow
the pythian age one arrow sped
and smile the spoiler tempt second blow
they fawn proud feet spurn lie low




the sun come forth mani reptil spawn
He set ephemer insect
Is gather death without dawn
and immort star awak
So world live men
godlik mind soar forth delight
make earth bare veil heaven
It sink swarm dim share light
leav kindr lamp spirit aw night




thu ceas mountain shepherd came
their garland sere magic mantl rent
the pilgrim etern whose fame
over live head like heaven bent
An earli endur monument
came veil lightn song
In sorrow from wild iern sent
the sweetest lyrist saddest wrong
and love taught grief fall like music tongu




midst other less note came one frail form
phantom among men companionless
As last cloud expir storm
whose thunder knell He guess
had gaze natur nake loveli
actaeonlik fled astray
with feebl step oer world wilder
and thought along rug way
pursu like rage hound father prey




pardlik spirit beauti swift
love desol mask power
girt round weak scarc uplift
the weight superincumb hour
It die lamp fall shower
break billow even whilst speak
Is broken On wither flower
the kill sun smile brightli cheek
the life burn blood even heart may break




hi head bound pansi overblown
and fade violet white pie blue
and light spear top cypress cone
round whose rude shaft dark ivi tress grew
yet drip forest noonday dew
vibrat everb heart
shook weak hand grasp Of crew
He came last neglect apart
herdabandon deer struck hunter dart




all stood aloof partial moan
smile tear well knew gentl band
who anoth fate wept
As accent unknown land
He sang new sorrow sad urania scan
the stranger mien murmur who art thou
He answer sudden hand
made bare brand ensanguin brow
which like cain christ Oh




what softer voic hush dead
athwart brow dark mantl thrown
what form lean sadli oer white deathb
In mockeri monument stone
the heavi heart heav without moan
If gentlest wise
taught sooth love honour depart one
let vex inharmoni sigh
the silenc heart accept sacrific




our adonai drunk poison oh
what deaf viper murder could crown
life earli cup draught woe
the nameless worm would disown
It felt yet could escap magic tone
whose prelud held envi hate wrong
but howl one breast alon
silent expect song
whose master hand cold whose silver lyre unstrung




live thou whose infami thi fame
live fear heavier chastis
thou noteless blot rememb name
but thyself know thyself
and ever thi season thou free
To spill venom thi fang oerflow
remors selfcontempt shall cling thee
hot shame shall burn upon thi secret brow
and like beaten hound trembl thou shalt




nor let us weep delight fled
far carrion kite scream
He wake sleep endur dead

through time chang unquench
whilst thi cold ember choke sordid hearth shame




peac peac dead doth sleep
He hath awaken dream life
T lost stormi vision keep
with phantom unprofit strife
and mad tranc strike spirit knife
invulner noth we decay
like corps charnel fear grief
convuls us consum us day day
and cold hope swarm like worm within live clay




He outsoar shadow night
envi calumni hate pain
and unrest men miscal delight
can touch tortur
from contagion world slow stain
He secur never mourn
heart grown cold head grown grey vain
nor spirit self ceas burn
with sparkless ash load unlament urn




He live wake t death dead
mourn adonais thou young dawn
turn thi dew splendour thee
the spirit thou lamentest gone
Ye cavern ye forest ceas moan
ceas ye faint flower fountain thou air
which like mourn veil thi scarf hadst thrown
oer abandon earth leav bare
even joyou star smile despair




He made one natur there heard
hi voic music moan
Of thunder song night sweet bird
He presenc felt known
In dark light herb stone

He portion loveli

As centr dart thi spirit light
