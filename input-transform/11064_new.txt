trehil well



there stood low ivi roof
As gaze rustic tell
In time chivalri song
yclept holi well

abov ivi branchlet gray
In glisten cluster shone
while round base grassblad bright
and spiri foxglov sprung

the brambl clung grace band
chequer old gray stone
with shine leaflet whose bright face
In autumn tint shone

around fountain eastern base
babbl brooklet sped
with sleepi murmur purl soft
adown gravelli bed

within cell filmi fern
To woo clear wave bent
and cushion moss stone
their quaint embroideri lent

the fountain face lay still glass
save streamlet free
across basin gnarl lip
flow ever silent

abov well littl nook
onc held rustic tell
all garlanddeck imag
the ladi well

they tell tale mysteri
Of darkl deed woe
but do might brook
the holi streamlet flow

Oh tell bitter thought
Of melancholi dream
By fair fount whose sunni wall
bask western beam

when last saw littl stream
form light stood
that seem like preciou gem
beneath archway rude

and gaze love awe
upon sylphlik thing
methought airi form must
the fairi spring

twin star aloft ether clear
around roll alway
within one common atmospher
Of mutual light day

and myriad happi eye bent
upon changeless love alway
As strengthen one intent

shed round us order love light
and shine unto perfect day

she lay among myrtl cliff
abov glare noon beneath sea
upon white horizon atho peak
welter burn haze air dead
the cical slept among tamarisk hair
the bird sat dumb droop far
the lazi seawe glisten sun
the lazi seafowl dri steam wing
the lazi swell crept whisper ledg
and sank great pan laid rest
and mother earth watch slept
and hush myriad children
she lay among myrtl cliff
and sigh sleep sleep would hear
but left toss still night day
mighti hunger yearn within heart
till vein ran fever cheek
her long thin hand ivorychannel feet
were wast wast soul
then peevishli flung face
and hid eyebal blind glare
and finger grass tri cool
her crisp hot lip crisp hot sward
and rais head upward cast
wild look homeless eye whose liquid light
gleam deep fold blueblack hair
As gleam twin lake purpl peak
Of deep parnassu mourn moon
besid lay lyre she snatch shell
and wake wild music silver string
then toss sadli by ah hush cri
dead offspr tortois mine
whi mock discord thine harmoni
although thriceolympian lot thine
onli echo back everi tone
the mood nobler natur thine

where clover corn lay sleep

there blood pointer feet
there blood game sell squir

Of freeman fanci slave

the young knight parabl



gay young knight burley stood
besid paw steed good
hi hand wrung wood
with wait love O

oh come stay
Or wast weari day
with fool wish far away
and hate love O

but came mighti boar
hi jowl tush red gore
and curl snout bore
bracelet rich rare O

the knight shriek ran flew
He search wild wood
but found nought save mantl blue
low roll within brake O

He twine wild briar red white
upon head garland dight
the green leav wither black night
and burnt brain O

fire blaze within breast
He mount aimless quest
He laid virgin lanc rest
and forest drove O

By rhinefield osmondsleigh
through leat furz brake fast drove
until saw homeless sea
that call wave O

He laugh aloud hear roar
and rush hors adown shore
the deep surg roll oer oer
and swept tide O

they tost ort south north
and grappl knee knee

beneath feet myrtl sweet

Ah cold pale moon thou cruel pale moon
that starest never frown
On grim ghastli thing
that wrought thorp town

and yet cold pale moon thou cruel pale moon
that night hadst never grace
To lighten two die christian men
To see one anoth face

they wrestl wrestl
they wrestl sore still
the fiend blind eye men
that night

like stag full spent among bent
they drop rest
when young man drove say knife
deep old man breast

the old man drove gunstock
upon young man head
and side side water brown
those yeomen twain lay dead

they dug three grave lyndhurst yard
they dug side side

Of thorn put dear brow

perhap martyr you forgot strength

Oh groan shall long pray

So thank lord hear breath

ON the death OF certain journal



So die thou child stormi dawn
thou winter flower forlorn nurs
chill earli bigot curs
the pedant frown worldl yawn

fair death fall teem june
when everi seed drop earth
take root win second birth
from steam shower gleam moon

fall warm fall fast thou mellow rain
thou rain god make fat land
that root parch burn sand
may bud flower fruit

To grace perchanc fairer morn
In mightier land beyond sea
while honour fall
from heart hero yet unborn

Of purer scienc holier law
bless us faint herald caus

It earl haldan daughter
she look across sea
she look across water
and long loud laugh
the lock six princess

So hey bonni boat ho bonni boat
who come woo

It earl haldan daughter
she walk along sand
when awar knight fair
came sail land
hi sail velvet
hi mast beaten gold
and hey bonni boat ho bonni boat
who saileth bold

the lock five princess
beyond sea
clipt golden tress
To fring cloak thee
one hand yet want
but one tale
So hey bonni boat ho bonni boat
furl thi velvet sail

He leapt water
that rover young bold
He gript earl haldan daughter
He clipt lock gold
go weep go weep proud maiden
the tale full today
now hey bonni boat ho bonni boat

In byzant besid sea

and came danub wide

then came great kaiser
with twice ten thousand men
but never thure coward enough
To wish home

bow thou rebel old athanarich
and beg thi life day
the kaiser lord world
and dare say nay

never came caucaland
To beg less
but see pride great kaiser
In micklegard shore

never came caucaland
To bow mortal wight
but shake hand great kaiser
and god defend right

He shook hand cun kaiser
and kiss courteousli
and ridden athanarich

He show ship hundr oar
and side like castl wall
that fetch home plunder world
At kaiser beck call

He show nation everi tongu
that bred beneath sun
how flow togeth micklegard street
As brook flow one

He show shop china ware
and silk sendal also
and show bath waterpip
On arch aloft go

He show ostrich unicorn
ape lion tiger keen
and eleph wise roar hail kaiser
As though christian

He show hoard dragon troll

now cun kaiser scholar wise
and could gramary
and cast spell old old balt
till lowli meek spake

oh oft heard micklegard
what held chapmen lie
but know micklegard
By sight mine eye

woden valhalla
but thou earth art god
and dare withstand thee kaiser
On head lie blood

then spake littl baltung
rode king right knee
quoth fridigern slew fals kaiser valen
and die like

To drink good greek wine

for feel heartstr fail

oh would kept great great oath

would never set foot roman ground
till day lay dead

oh would home caucaland
To hear harper play
and drink last nutbrown ale
while gave gold ring away

oh would home caucaland
To hear gothmen horn
and watch waggon brown brood mare
and tent born

but must die four stone wall
In byzant besid sea
and thou shalt deal littl baltung
So god shall deal thee

the kaiser purg oath
and buri royal
and set barrow idol gold
where roman must bow knee

and goth kaiser men
and guard lanc sword
and littl baltung sworn sonatarm
and eat kaiser board

and kaiser two son two fals white lad

Is rome italian land
but shall fall littl baltung
when shall take lanc hand

and part plunder rome
He shall pay song mine

the priest S heart



It sir john fair young priest
He strode strand
but seven fisher maiden left behind
all danc hand hand

He came unto wise wife hous
now mother prove art
To charm may carleton merri blue eye
out young man heart

mi son went holi man
whose heart set high
Go sing psalter read book
man love fleet lightli

liever talk may carleton
than saint heaven
liever sit may carleton
than climb sphere seven

watch fast earli late
pray
but find cure save churchyard mould
for pain men call love

now heaven forefend ill grow wors
enough ill ill
know spell draw may carleton
and bend

if thou didst thou canst
wise woman though thou
would run run till buri
In surg yonder sea

scathless maid wife
and scathless shall bide
yet charm may carleton eye heart
that ach left side

she charm white witchcraft
she charm black
but turn fair young face wall
till heard heartstr crack

the legend OF LA brea  a



down besid loathli pitch lake
In state morich  b
sat ancient spanish indian
peer column tall

watch vainli flash
Of jewel colibri  c
listen vainli hum
round honeyblossom tree

few sigh they come fewer
To cocorit  d  bower
murder madli forest
which yore

By came negro hunter
lith lusti sleek strong
roll round sparkl eyebal
As lope loung along

rusti firelock shoulder
rusti cutlass thigh
never jollier british subject
rollick underneath sky

british law give safeti
british fleet guard shore
and squar british freehold
He

fatten endless summer
like provis ground
He reach summum bonum
which latest wit found

So thought hammock
gnaw junk sugarcan
toast plantain firestick
gnaw doze gnaw

had wife ajoupa
Or least instead
children die earli
He d need earn bread

never stole save need
from crown wood round
never lie except summon
let warden find

never drank except market
never beat sturdi mate
she could hit hard could
and hard pate

had care priest parson
hope heaven fear hell
and view natur
held comt peter bell

healthi happi silli kindli
neither care toil
save work hour sunris
and hunt colibri

not bad man good man
scarc man one fear
If man within us
which born fire tear

round palmstem round creeper
flash feather jewel past
rubycrest topazthro
pluck cocorit bast

pluck fallen ceibacotton
whir away build nest
hung last happi hum

Up went rusti muzzl

but sprang indian shout
balk negro prey

rusti nail nine charm

saw vision cock head
In path white
saw brinvilli   pottag
falter cold damp fright

fear chanc poison
fear great unknown
magic bring positivist
humbl marrowbon

like weddingguest enchant
there stood trembl cur
while indian told stori
like ancient marin

told onc loathli pitch lake
wa garden bright fair
how chayma mainland
built palm ajoupa

how throve fatten
hale happi safe strong
pass livelong day feast
pass night danc song

till cruel grew wanton
till kill colibri
then outspak great good spirit

negro man take care take care
He wanton god bounti
Of god wrath best bewar

for sauci reckless heartless

Ah male hog armour

To meet dear boy come back
and catch turn valley
the last weari chime pack

the climb homeward park moorland
and fir forest
while southwest wind roar gloam
like ocean seeth champagn

and night septett beethoven
and grandmoth chair
and foot feet sofa
beat delic time air

Ah god poor soul thank thee
for delect day
though furi fool swindler

juventu mundi



list tale fairi sent us
fresh dear mundi juventu
when love world young
and bird convers well sung
and men still face fair creation
with humour heart imagin
who come hither morocco
everi spring sirocco
In russet yellow
sing ever clear mellow
sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet
did beat did beat
phyllopneust wise folk call
but nt know befal
whi ever thought come
all way hear gnat hum
whi built nest hous
like bumblebe mousi
nor littl bird got wing
nor t small cock sing
how know stupid fogi
they dare nt even believ bogi
onc girl boy
each life joy
He daphni chloe
onli brown snowi
till arab found play
far beyond atla stray
tie helpless thing togeth
drove burn weather
In slavegang mani leagu
till drop wild fatigu
Up caught whip hide
lash soft brown back side
till littl brain burst
with sharp pain heat thirst
over poor boy lay
tri keep blow away
till stiffen clay
and ruffian rode away
swoop oer taint ground
carrion vultur gather round
and gaunt hyena ran
track caravan
but ah wonder gone
which meant feast upon
and yellow wren
one cock one hen
sweetli warbl flit forth
oer desert toward north
but shade bygon sorrow
like dream upon morrow
round tini brainlet cling
set wee cock ever sing
sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet
did beat did beat
vultur croak hop flop
but even meal stop
and gaunt hyena foul
sat tail howl
northward toward cool spring weather
those two wren fled togeth
On england oer sea
where folk alik free
there built cabin wattl
like hut first prattl
hatch fed safe may
mani tini feather babi
but autumn south go
past strait atla snow
over desert mountain
To palm besid fountain
where live
told first old old stori
what dove say curuck coo
you love love





valentin S day



Oh wish tini browni bird south
settl among alderholt twitter stream
would put tini tail put tini mouth
and sing tini life away one melodi dream

would sing blossom sunshin sky
and tini wife mean cosi nest
and one came shot dead could die
with tini life tini song end best
