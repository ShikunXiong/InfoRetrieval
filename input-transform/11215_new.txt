ti sweet boyhood visionari mood
when glow fanci innoc gay
fling forth like mote bright aerial brood
To danc shine hope prolif ray
T sweet unweet flight year
may darkl roll trial tear
To dress futur garb list
and shape thousand joy never may exist
but sad wight feverish train
fool d phantom wizard brain
most wildli dote young ambit sting
To trust weight upon poetic wing
He downward look airi ride
behold elysium bloom everi side
unearthli bliss thrill nerv attun
and thu dreamer commun
ye earth shall wit ere star set
that partial natur mark d pet
that phoebu doom d kind indulg sire
To mount car set world fire

and age infanc shall gape see
the lucki bard whisper that

poor youth print wake to sleep more
the world goe indiffer
and first notic metric skill

To pen soft note fair enthusiast stir
except laundress valu
none though bard may burn
her note still expect one return
the luckless maiden unblest shall sigh
hi pocket tome hath drawn pocket dri
hi tragedi expir peal laughter
and soulthril wish live hereaft
give way one hopeless quit fear
and far need live here
where ye divin illus

matur reflect

O love divinest dream youth

My bosom touch d time truth

nor thou ambit eer

and aspir fierc vain

If man hath consol left
On side death t good old port

and thou advic glum chill

sketch from life

Or naiad mossi purpl bank
Of wild woodland stream feet

Or like shape western cloud

and teach even wind melodi
how shall tell beauti eye

In low breath twilight wind
one glanc upon lip besid whose hue
the morn rose would sicken grow pale
till wake soft breath
that steal music lip love
wert thou statu could pine thee
but thi live beauti awe
the sacred modesti enshrin
the rubi lip bright brow beam eye

shall hail thi presenc consecr maid
whether beneath vault abbey dome
where evri footstep sound everi tomb
where superstit marbl stone

Or churchyard lone thou sittst weep

but hither come yon swoln arch gaze
and view vivid flash erupt blare

Ah look yonder tempestshaken cloud

and speak mission feebl row

Of old splendid mansion great

and wait write thi remain t past
oft genii hoari blade
around thi wall hellborn demon led
yet hast thou triumph d oer monster car
and brave ill pestilenti war
oft hast thou seen circl season roll
In fond success round thi nativ pole
defi hoari matron ring
and seen sicken lap spring
but ah thi timeclad head shall rise
To dare tempest shake sky
nor one small wreck invad fair concav
nor shout crumbl basi save
when rise zephyr thi ruin bring
world atom fairi wing

din horribl though rebel train
had sprung chao fought fall n
rave high bolt yon old structur fell
how everi cranni trembl yell
Of fright owl whose secret haunt forlorn
were kindr vault wind torn
Of bold antiqu rough pencil born
thrice fanci lead dismal echo round
and paint spectr glide oer ground
from evri turret evri vanquish d tower
In heap confus broken fragment pour
and plung toward pebbl grave
like wizard wand draw circl wave

where chill d apathi cold frost extend

Or thi fall n fortun coldli whisper round

OR the poet S last poem


Ye bard thousand den
great soul fewer penc pen
sublim ador apollo
with folio full purs hollow
whose soul raptur glisten
when find fool listen
who debt paid pun
would never complet done
Ye bright inhabit garret
whose dream rich port claret
who lofti paradis
see alderman banquet rise
and though dun around troop
still float sea turtl soup
forsak tune trade
where none lordl paid
Or northern rogu sit pule
the curs univers school
ploughman countri lost
An author printer cost
slave everi man ll buy
knave everi man ll tri
yet let take pen
the laurel gather round sconc

On everi subject supersed
My favorit topic invad
scarc dip pen prais
when fifti bardl grasp bay
Or let touch drop satir
knew someth matter
just fifti bardl take troubl
To tune worship doubl
fine simili noth fit
joe miller must pass wit
the dull dri brainbesieg joke
the humour laugh provok
the nameless worthless witless rancour
the rage soul scribbler canker
administ d gall go thick
It make even sunday critic sick
disgust passion fill place
and snatch prize face

If take brilliant pen
and scorn measur talk men
there luttrel step twixt fame
So like egad re
never half squeez thought
but jump fellow spot
My tenderest dream fondest touch
are victim readi clutch
the whirl waltz gay costum
the porcelain tooth gallic bloom
the vapid smile lisp love
Of turtl never meant dove
the dreari stuff fill ear
where all orat peer
the hide reveal d ballroom dress
where parti peeress
the dul toujour gai
the yawn night sleepi day
the visag chees chalk
the drowsi dreami languid talk
the fifti horrid thing
that strip old time wing
there topic
but come hey presto his call

Or turn pen love
theme fit like glove
pang ve born twenti year
with tentim twenti sever dear
each glanc dart smile quiver
sting bard lung liver
To work ruin cure
Up start thi pen anacreon moor
In vain pour shower rose
On matchless fair one doze
and plant around conch grace
while jealou venu break lace
To see younger face promot
To see old face outvot
and myrtl branch twist oer
bow turn d true ador
Up start irish bard vain
write t grain
In vain talk smile sigh
the girl eye
and soul mamma miss
but vow sole bard bliss

Of blue flame bluest flame

TO the review

Oh ye enthron presidenti awe
To give songsmit gener law
who wield apollo deleg rod
and shake parnassu sovereign nod
pensiv pilgrim worn base turmoil
plebeian care mercenari toil
implor piti footstep rude
He dare within mountain pale intrud
for oh enchant empir dwell
and rule spirit lethean spell
By hand unseen aerial harp hung
and spring like hebe ever fair young
On broad bosom rear laugh love
and breath bland incens warbl grove
spontan bid unfad blossom blow
and nectar d stream melliflu flow

there muse wanton unconfin
and wreath resplend round templ bind
T strew step votiv flower
To watch slumber midst bliss bower
To guard shade hide sacr charm
and shield beauti unhallow d arm
Oh may suppliant steal pass kiss
ala pant superior bliss
thricebless d virgin modesti shall
To snatch evanesc ecstaci
the fierc extrem superhuman love
for frail sens exquisit might prove
He turn blush th aoenian shade
To humbler raptur mortal maid

know t unscholast wight
unloos fanci presumptu flight
awak vengeanc flight frown
clip wing d hors roll rider
but empow d strike th immort lyre
the ardent votri glow genuin fire
T care recoil envi fli
subdu resistless energi
T bid pierian fountain flow
and toast name wit seraglio
To bind brow amaranthin bay
and bless beef beer mundan day
ala beef beer bay mine
If look doom may divin
Ye frown dread ye swell big
your fate arm goosequil wig
the wig wisdom sombrou seal impress d
mysteri terror grim portent invest
and shame honour goosequil perch
like dove raven countri church

As raw squir rustic nymph admir
Of vulgar charm easi conquest tire
resolv new scene nobler flight dare
nor wast sweet desert air
To town repair fame assembl seek
with red import blustr cheek
but electr th astonish d wight
burst full flood music light
while level d mirror multipli row
Of radiant beauti accomplish d beau
At confound sober sens
He feel pristin insignific
and blink blundr gener quiz
retreat ponder thing
By pride inflat prais allur
small author thu strut forth thu get cure
but critic hear angel plead me
that tongueless tentongu cherub modesty

sir damn ll resembl
that flay d travel lost cloth
are foe enough do book
relentless trunkmak pastrycook
acknowledg barbar alli
the wooden boxmen men pie
for heav n sake let neer understood
that great censor coalesc wood
nor let action contradict look
that tell world neer colleagu cooks

but blith muse indulg smile
whi scowl thi brow O booksel
thi sunk eye glisten eclips fear
fill d like cassandra prophet tear
with visag wither woebegon
shrink pale poet damn dun
come let us teach tear flow
like fast bard fellowship woe
when coy muse put coquettish air
nor deign one line voraci prayer
thi spirit groan like th encumb d block
which bear work deplor dead stock

To endless sleep delia cruscan rhyme
ye critic whisper thee litigi wretch
oblivion hand shall finish sketches
but see my soul bugbear repel d
