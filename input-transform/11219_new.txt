the watchman S lament


As homeward hurri within the wen
At midnight alon
My knee like knee drunken man
forebod shook eye began
To see two lamp one

the light burnt blue re wont
when spirit wind
Ho ho thought omin hue
and glanc either side threw
but fear d look behind

smell ga spread far wide
but sulphur knew
My sight grew dim tongu tie
and thought home sweet firesid
and friend left loo

and took hurri peep
along across street
and beheld figur creep
like man walk sleep
Or watchman beat

lantern dangl wind
He bore shaggi thick
greatcoat one dreadnought kind
what seem d right hand trail d behind
the like stick

the sky cloud becam oercast
and suddenli set rain
and gaslight flicker d blast
As thing lantern dreadnought past
and heard thu complain

murrain seiz pize upon
plagu take new polic
whi could nt ancient one
As age age done
and let us remain peac

No ah never fear
will perquisit woe
Or profit vail charley cheer
then ala tender consort dear
and infant progeni

farewel freak jovial spark
who rejoic gentl riot
To midnight spree morn lark
there ll never fun dark
and peopl sleep quiet

No shall tom jerri
engag fisti battl
break mani head peac
like know row
when neer rattl

one cri ear shall grate
convivi friend alarm
who straightway start separ
bless late
To break parti charm

but ruthless foe wilt punish d anon
bundl without piti parley
hi offic occup gone
lost disgrac despis undon
Oh ll rememb charley

just beheld jarvey near
