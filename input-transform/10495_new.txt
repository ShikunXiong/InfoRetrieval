the great king constantin hunt
the brilliant cavalcad knight dame
On palfrey charger trap gold
and silver red purpl ride mirth
along wind way hill tarn
and violetsprinkl dell impati hound
sniff keen morn air startl bird
rustl foliag redol spring

from time time courtier rein steed
besid loveenkindl gwendolain
whose wayward mood vari wind
now woo soft seduct grace
now fascin state pride
anon bewitch reckless
Of wil dare wild capric
which one could anticip stay
how fair today how beauti
her huntingrob bluer sky
match one phase great chang eye
clasp twin falcon unburnish gold
the colour brown hair sun
the white plume droop huntingcap
leav allur lip tempt sight
but hide grow shadow eye
for mark none court today
save sir sanpeur pass nobl knight
whose bear doth bespeak heroic deed
there ride sweet maid ettonn

sir torm husband fair gwendolain
Is unconsci aught els besid
the outward seem t enough
that gay beauti smile
He natur small limit
By sight sens self desir
heart open day
that touch quick impuls cost
him naught sacrific the needi poor
flock castl careless gift
Of fall dole esquir faint
from exact servic night day
hi ladi gwendolain satiat
with costli gem palfrey samit thick
with thread gold silver sweet
heart subtleti fair observ
are lost of course marri life
He see quickli fail smile
but never see shadow eye
hi hound beaten till scarc draw breath
and caress beyond worth hound
hi vassal know day day
He approv strike curs
hi humour byword court
and goodhearted
hi prowess undaunt strength arm
men would speak lightli disdain
He often stormi rage
Or supplic humour aton
too petti repent truth
too light yield repent
hi temper forc spent digniti
Of truest knighthood No one feel fault
So quickli flush regret
and shame gwendolain but wife
hi honour would hide
from world even
hi petti narrow soul
So forget doth pretend forget
where fail save pass bound
then swift scorn pierc forc dread
flash upon like probe lanc
To silenc merriment coars
To hush wrath violent

though power check neer could chang
the underflow current life
In first year gone ere grown
woman world essay
To stem tide shallow vaniti
To realis girlhood high ideal
and make home rever fine
sir torm overborn word jest
and noisi laughter vow would learn
romanc sweet simplic well
for harper minstrel sing hall
but courtier live world
onc face thought motherhood
for brief day sweet expect
never fulfil awar
Of thirst live water dread
Of light shallow life led fell
she went torm spoke broken word
the unform long dawn soul
He lightli laugh fillip ear call
My ladi abbess pretti saint
said later jest court
behold ladi good lord
the blood swept cheek lose
In hair gold eb leav

momentari hate torm impot
He saw pallor eye downdropt
came quickli flung arm around say
god faith girl mind jest
where spirit wont
My lord shall fail
she answer bitterli
torm see soul unveil
thenceforth turn strive truth
To win outward charm complet
and hid inner self deepli neath

and sir sanpeur ride ettonn

As talk lightli courtier gay
jealou impati gwendolain
whom men flatter thwart fight
tender yearn defi pride
and call one spoken word
the world seem better talk
No one ever lift
the empti noth courtli life
As sir sanpeur make life death
more grandli solemn yet simpli clear
In steep curv road turn
To meet smile deepen come
sanpeur bronz eastern sun tall
straight javelin nobl line
hi knighthood reveal slighter torm
whose strength size full strong
sanpeur unrival strength sinew
hi scarlet garb deep fur miniv
Is broider cross leav untold
the fame land tell
upon breast wear silver dove
the sacr order holi ghost
which gwendolain note word
what famou honour lord
and answer knightli grace
My ladi gwendolain seldom think
Of high honour though greatli prize
thi recognit far beyond worth
My thought ever signifieth
It consecr belong
To god father sign
Of hi holi spirit sent us
By ascend saviour jesu christ
By whom alon live day day
hi quiet word amid laugh court
had startl solemn peal
Of full cathedr music rung clear
abov joust cri halt Ho
then wonder man
like men priest knightli garb
He spoke rich jewel delight
and worldli wisdom tell tale
Of mani jewel mysteri wore
In far east sapphir stone held
To talisman love truth
So fitli place upon robe
It stone stone girdl

As foamfleck charger carnaflang
He ride today toward ladi gwendolain

and lieg must wellnigh oercom
with vast load duti fulfil
So nobli glori realm

In lieu fight would
unto death knight
and dame spoke earnestli
To constantin said next speech
with sir sanpeur life merri play
To naught els seldom think beyond

and would humour pass mood

one day court restless spirit rose
To defiant mood reckless
and half want true
and half could act fals
except overdo clear laugh
rang witti word heart disdain
some knight ignobl hate nobl men
were loud decri virtu gwendolain
with laughbeget word made quick assent
To unworthi wit

she scarc spoken
ere sanpeur rais penetr eye

and everi act influenc

although word

she knew love wist knew

and revel born
wider knowledg life mysteri
sir torm never satisfi soul
but though outward seem proud
highspirit pass courtli dame
At heart ladi gwendolain still
hungri child crave love nourish
unconsci hunger clung
In spite shock repeat time time
close thought torm rememb
He woo rehears
As children count penni one one
day day prove wealth good
and sign promis natur gener
until buoyant heart quick react
had warm kept aliv
By warmth fire earnest zeal
and men lost morass feed fast
On berri lest starv call food
thu shut eye gwendolain till
fed affect chanc tender
and call great aw name
Of love know love meant but swift
As light flood darken chamber one fling
the window wide unconsci soul
wa flood strang incom thought
In etern moment true love
love vital forc within soul
strength power illum light
and sanpeur love O immort crown
she consciou love
her love love enough

then awok joy thing becam
pregnant deep signific the sky
flush come rosi dawn
the mountain reach heavenward sun
that warm flower drank dew bird
that built nest well hid leafi shade
the grass bent homag wind
all touch heart anew subtl thought
and joy brought rich unfold life

she piti men scorn
more quick forgiv enviou dame
and littl children cross path
she stoop kiss wont

ala often new harmoni
Of life clash discord sir torm flung
upon homag sanpeur render
unworthi jest spite word well
He hate grudg despit
full oft wrath rous point
He could hold peac even king
He jeer one day visionari knight
the keeney king intuit knew
the motiv speech our knight sanpeur
but contradict verdict torm prove
that great king arthur taught man
Is strongest claim strength divin
from whenc draw sir torm grown
more wrath heart kept
sanpeur long word gwendolain
then torm anger baffl
sometim doubt would come doubt hide joy
sir sanpeur honour court
with chivalr frankest loyalti
At great tournament christmastid
He cri such peerless presenc midst
As unrival ladi gwendolain
strengthen arm prove without peer
let disput those
but prove fall worship
He overthrew simpl eas
hi caus seem justic rather love boast
then met convers face face
He spoke unsulli fearless soul
straight without reserv fear
yet wrap calm selfcontrol

He never moment space forgot
To woman queen servingmaid
and maiden eye gave bright respons
To fair word thoughtbetak grace
the heart gwendolain would faster beat
and wayward would quick return
then sanpeur approach would mock
At life love fling gauntlet
As challeng tournament speech

He touch tenderli said god faith

those hellish scar mar peerless cheek

she turn head quick hand embrac
buri cheek within palm said
those scar torm would resign
for dower world could give
they order higher life
the birthmark new nobil

In fair eye thing els

Of love tender

At last strife
between deep yearn touch love
and brave endeavour selfmasteri

To lone sea brought agoni
To face boldli spirit quick
To wear new mood caught despond gloom

they talk dark plot kill king

the heart christalan beat faint
and oft wearili beat fast strong
In anxiou listen It band
Of outlaw robber rebel king
who plan lay great undern hunt

and face come trace fear
Or tremor bear slight frail
In white doublet hold hand
