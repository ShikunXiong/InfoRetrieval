He might made enough enough

and turn judgment came
and scare back

the wind and the moon

So deep heap
Of cloud sleep

On high sky
with one ghost eye
the moon shone white aliv plain
said wind blow

the wind blew hard moon grew dim
with sledg wedg
knock edg
If blow right fierc grim
the creatur soon dimmer dim

He blew blew thin thread
one puff enough
To blow snuff
one good puff last bred
and glimmer glimmer glum go thread

He blew great blast thread gone
In air nowher
wa moonbeam bare
far harmless shi star shone
sure certain moon gone

the wind took revel
On town
like merrymad clown
He leap hollo whistl roar
what the glimmer thread

He flew rage danc blew
but vain pain
Of burst brain
for still broader moonscrap grew
the broader swell big cheek blew

slowli grew till fill night
and shone throne
In sky alon
matchless wonder silveri light
radiant love queen night

said wind what marvel power
with breath good faith
blew death
first blew away right sky
then blew strength

but moon knew noth affair
for high sky
with one white eye
motionless mile air
she never heard great wind blare

and grasp ancient blade
He murmur warren name

T dread immort day

Oh keep sword accent broke

it glori grow still
and twenti million bless sire
and sword bunker hill
