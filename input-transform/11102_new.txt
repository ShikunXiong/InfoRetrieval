the charg OF the nigger ninth ON san juan hill

BY georg E powel

hark oer drowsi trooper dream
there come martial metal scream
that startl one
It word wake die
To hear foeman fierc defi
To fling column battlecri
the boot saddl call

the shimmer steel glow morn
the rallycal battlehorn
proclaim day carnag born
for better ill
abov pictur tentag white
abov weapon glint bright
the day god cast golden light
across san juan hill

forward forward come cri
As stalwart column ambl
stride grave wait lie
undug mother earth
their goal flag fierc castil
abov serri rank steel
insens cannon peal
that give battl birth

As brawn black fearless foe
grave grim grand onward go
To conquer die
the rule right march might
duski host darker night
respons morn light
To work martial
and oer trench trembl earth
the morn give battl birth
Is san juan hill

hark sound bugl call
let ring rifl
To shriek battlepal
the wargod jubile
their bondmen low long
their weak strong
their strike stay wrong
that stranger might free

and weal woe
the tawni face grimmer go
that bade merci foe
that pitti kill
close close heard said
and yet rain steel lead
still leav livid trail red

charg charg the bugl peal
T life death roosevelt men
the mauser make repli
aye speechless swarthi son
save clamor gun
their battlecri
the lowli stain upon face
the taunt still fresh prouder race
but speed step spring pace
To succor die

with rifl hot waistband nude
the brawn besid pamper dude
the cowboy king one grave rude
To shelter fall
one breast bare howe begot
the low high one common lot
the world distinct forgot
when freedom bugl call

No falter step fit start
none seek less part
one watchward spring heart
yet onward still
the sullen sound tramp tread
abe lincoln flag still overhead
they follow angel led
the way san juan hill

and life stream ebb flow
and stain track trenchant blow
that met meaner steel
the bate breath battl yell
the turf slipperi crimson tell
where castil proudest color fell
with wound never heal

where everi trooper found wreath
Of glori sabr sheath
and earn laurel well
with feet field face foe
In line battl lie low
the sabl soldier fell

and black brawni breast
gave life richest best
To find tomb etern rest
dream freedom still
groundless creed swept away
with brand coward timeworn say
and blaze path better way
Up side san juan hill
for black white scroll fame
the blood hero dye
and ever ever

sleep trooper sleep thi sabl brow
amid live laurel
Is wound wreath fame
nor need graven granit stone
To tell garland thine
To hold soldier name
