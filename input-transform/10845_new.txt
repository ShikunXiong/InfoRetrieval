Of uggolino pisa hapless count
how shall muse piteou tale relat
near citi gentl mount

they lock d dread recount
with three tender babe share fate
but five year old eldest three
Oh could rob babe liberti

coars food scantili suppli
prelud death captiv die

and luckless day thu befel
about surli jailer wont hour
To bring food enter d cell
but bolt fast prison outer door
thi counti heart rang like knell
hope exclud grizzli tow r
speechless sat despair forbad rave
thi hold dungeon grave

hi youngest babe seen summer three
father cri man delay
To bring food naughti must
eat morsel day
dear father got bread
Oh give pray
hungri sleep
ll kiss father weep

and day day pine innoc
thu father piteous cri
till hunger perform d stern intent
Of fierc foe Oh father shall die

He mark d wild distract mien
which count immort reynold drew
when bitter woe despair famin keen
unit sad face shock view
will wish gaze th appal scene
for piti sake stori true
what heart fiend less hellish hate
could eer consign group fate

and saw darl child dead

He tore mat lock head
and bit arm grief wrung heart
hi two surviv babe drew near said
think t hunger thorn cau d smart
