well well ye deem love
Ye world love pass well

As wind play frail waterbel

nay thu far would reflect go

but thou man dark mystic aim

leav light trodden path grope
mid fear specul wild dream

Ay thou sayest well
thou sayest well how oft random shaft
striketh king truth betwixt armourjoint

which way tend fear what certain aim

roger

We say light receiv
against law prudenc love

that strang motion incant spell
So work spirit strang sleep
sombr death dark shadow present
steal oer fragil bodi dull sens
and wrap wholli chill embrac

mauric

Ay love would eye miss d

melt fresh full ruddi glow health
To loveli heavenli yet sad
her cheek youth summer d rose

and larg dark eye seem gaze
some angel mute melancholi look
As casement jar world

Ha seen
O heaven delus fond dream
but even work work bliss

that eye saw angel fire
pure dross dim cloud earth
deem d frame ether unakin
To earth claymould fabric perchanc
As enter heaven might left dust
At bright fold portal sandallik
and thenc repass seraph tranc
still left unclaim d vestur gate

roger

you glori weak T much
rash man bewar bitter end come

mauric

fain would think studi hath oerwrought
your heat brain short fever fit
that soon may pass leav vision clear
In truth note strang chang mien
wander glanc quick restless eager
rapt snatch deep thought wherein mind
seem cleav heaven wild extat wing
your cheek pale nervou frame
thrill neath strang enthusiast touch
lay book awhil breath
As day gone countri air
the sweet calm countri air perfum float
like love find heart godlik larg
can clasp wholli one embrac
but overflow creation bliss
thu shall quickli exorcis mad
and cleans brain pernici dream

oran

thi mad bethink past
Of great nobl toil d
amid deep dark mine burn thought
wear life quarri forth truth
Of seer watcher earli late
wait eager bloodhot eye light
rise afar untrodden east
full divin preciou influenc
call like mezzuin minaret
the thankless world worship glad
Of patient thinker earth
who talk d wisdom like familiar friend
until voic unaccustom d grew
and men stare blankli pass d
bethink know
how walk d labyrinth scorn
and account mad men
but patienc winter bear within breast
the nascent seed golden harvesttim

thi shall tell way
stray mid scienc wealth
discov d vast hidden power
power perfect shall sure work
great revolut human law
where stop cours yet know
T like sun day
shine godlik vision night
though dark hide bright still feel
shine glori sphere
It power benefic good
that grant spirit infinit control
over matter free soul
from flesh shackl sensuou mean
what els influenc health
for happi bless say
save glimps vast power unknown
dawn wonder mind like man
stand upon giddi pinnacl
with whole world seen faint small
close mine eye fear joy
To mabel bear love
some firstfruit find make rich
that gaze eye may behold
how sweet heaven dear happi
thi sum work
then though thank good intent
leav untroubl life thought
leav trust arm love

roger

you love fals man heart soul

Ay wear thu feel semblanc
pale visionari shall paus
but strong hand arrest mad career
soon return arm d father power
To snatch sister fear art

mauric

Oh love sir
If yet upon dial life
her sun mark short sweet hour joy
and swiftli shadow glide
If yet prize love heart hold
from mad delus waken
that blindli blight seek bless
ceas utopian unsaf essay
and rather turn studiou care call
the fade rose back cheek
and shed health glad feebl frame
reflect whilst yet may lest late remors
stalk ghostlik chamber soul
haunt gloomi void evermor

not love O god thou knowest

As men hold crystal gainst sun

Lo heart like chaotic world

In deep scarceword murmur desir

the summer sunset yellow d wheat
and ripe year harvest promis full

like one long hour toil last
see glad work accomplish d peac

and sent hymnal music breez
To stood halfpray side

and broke bank silenc love

and found life found joy evermor
It yesterday time

with fragrant blossom like onehour bride
and claspeth summer soft plead arm
that though neer eager gone

and drop hoard flower upon way

To win fame still might shine
and een dear thought wondrou power

A pause

It aim deepli weigh d

A long pause

but setteth free soul what real need

At lowest gladden gleam bliss

A pause

what angel smitten grace

the dove came twice unto ark
with messag peac hope joy
but third time return d she dove
Oh wing d ever long heart
the water life would quick subsid
and leav strand shoal time
what god saw hover aloft
and smile amongst cherubim
what draught bliss lethelik

So sought never never

No shall fate tempt wealth
lest covet rob

A pause

and yet dream poor selfish fear
that scumlik float dim love limpid tide
shall thu cage bird liberti
and let beat life bar
lest dear bliss detain heaven
shall spill rashli forth wine joy

Ah alon shall take thought

A pause

O wonder thou mansion tenantless
unswept memori untrod thought

No whisper stir round silent place
No foot guest across startl hall
No rustl robe corridor
No voic float waveless air
No laughter sweet song like angel dream
On silver wing among arch dome
No swan upon mere golden prow

No flap sail idl wind
No music puls great wild heart
In sweetest passionbeat noontid
No lover glide sunchequ d glade

spring


On like giant stalketh strong wind
wrap cloud close dark
rift creation soul rage blind
No piti hath earth stark
shiver beneath loos drift snow
scanti shroud hide dead

dead there life within mother breast
So claspeth young one heart
the time come time come rest rest
let mad greybeard north depart
earth shall aris mock grave
patienc littl let dotard rave

the palsi bough grew still came paus
and natur heart scarc beat listen
gaze abroad tempestflaw
with prayer long saviour spring
and heard spring come sky
earth rose threw shroud joy

then wept like niob
beheld children spring round feet
rais young voic earli day
that never ear seem d sweet
and soft murmur thousand rill
proclaim d spring loos hill

the bright evangel came girt round mirth
and garland youth crown d flower
awak aris ye son new birth
and move quick measur hour
summer come go ye forth meet
with sweetest hymen song greet

So aros straightway joyou train
gather d everi nook hedgerow shade
that passag oer verdant plain
still heart thrill music made
sweet pilgrim love youth gay time
lead year golden prime

and myriad wing thing whose radiant dye
made sunshin beauti still hover d oer
and bore wit sunlit sky
and rise tomb glad amaz

the bittern


the reed idli wave oer marshi ground
the rank rag herbag rot mani mound
and desol pool marsh deadli lie around

there life motion save wind fli
with closemuffl cloud silenc sky
there sound stir save bittern cri

the bittern sit sadli flute edg
Of pillar prop pride palac ledg
now smear d damp decay sunk slimi sedg

shatter d sunken sculptur architrav
peer surfac sluggish wave
like gaunt limb thrust fleshless shallow grave

the bittern sitteth sadli timeworn stone
upon life moulder relic fear alon
sear silenc ofttim solemn tone

the bittern monarch sad dreari place
mock pride pageant ruin d race
whose name forgotten whose deed left trace

the pleasant song peac lute lover sigh
the statesman eloqu warrior battlecri
have pass d like echo heedless sky
the lone bittern note come sadli float

Oh melancholi sound shall thu ever end
the glori great whither hope tend
and past come boom shall present wend

No ear listen old hardearn d glori
that wore heart made lock grow scant hoari
No ear listen tongu tell stori

the bittern sitteth midst marsh past
sitteth amidst ruin whilst hour fleet fast
and hoars cri looketh round aghast

the hour fleet fast unnot time nigh
when even noiseless wing shall soar high
till deep note lost amid azur sky

and chill d long long rest

In godsacr far away

and clear chalic youth

No mortal ear rejoic

No wist eye tear woe

In godsacr far away
where O god lie cold
cold cold

god angel cometh pure bright
make radianc night
unto place mute lie
gaze rapt devot
shaken deep emot
and thought longer go
wander oer plashi clay
In godsacr far away
where O god lay cold
cold cold

god angel ah divin bright
but still olden grace
the soft brown eye raven hair
the gentl smile calm delight
that could peac joy impart
the veil rent heart
and gaze upward well know
the rain may beat upon clay
In godsacr far away
but longer lie
enshroud frost snow

the star IN the east


oer wide world wander evermor

On cloudcapt mountain seawash d shore

oer wide world world know
and stare stupid scorn see go
whilst solemn secret face pass
To laugh desert spot none nigh

and found amid myriad light

lest the star hapli linger

So know well virgin grace

and last fold golden mantl trail

for petti pleasur bend god soul low

how great wonder hate

the wind sweep weirdli oer heaven tonight
weirdli black though guilti deed
from sad shipwreck taken flight
leav drown dire plight
leav drown d low wave weed

No star star Oh woe

and must crouch amidst wind rain
without one hopegleam lighten pain

and faint wander afar afar
and dim eye see thing seek
and yet must ask must speak

No dumb dumb shall set scan

there land whereon sun warm gaze

and weak earth quit smitten ray

where royal lion snuff free pure air
and everi breez laugh tyrant chain
Be nest slaveri despair
rear brood whose craven soul

but shore vast sea sand
stretch afar countri rich green
with wave foliag shade land
and flow water bright sunni sheen
and brows countless herd dappl deer

rear hoari summit sky
As claim empir firmament

sternfeatur children titan birth

within shadow mani peopl dwell
divid kingdom gather d round chief
with lodg cluster d stream well
To yield cattl ever cool relief
from fierc scorch burn sun
and slake hot thirst toil done

It chanc war still doth enter
where men fewest small great
here sudden rais hellish din
and woke furi lust bloodi hate
So battl foray murder theft
rang oft echo mountain cleft

there one tribe unconsci eas
slumber d thought danger dream
heard tramp men upon breez
while star watch faint trembl beam
saw noiseless spectr round villag creep
like apparit unquiet sleep

then silencemurd d yell aros
and scare sleeper rush forth fear
met death without portal dim foe
Or eer warrior could grasp spear
Or fit arrow unstrung bow
Or ward fatal stroke laid low

So plunder captur band
Of hapless women ere morn light
flit victor swiftli land

leav lion hungri crew
To clear morn bloodi dew

To meet joyou forth women came
and led back triumph fold
taunt foe mani bitter shame
though lay death aim stark cold
whilst poor captiv rack d fear woe
cower d close togeth fate hapless blow

soon came trader coast
the weep captiv marshal d
and barter d singli heartless men
each bosom trembl still fear doubt
but truth burst hoars cri
Of wild despair ascend sky

there one tree life
pluck d yet blossom fruit year
scarc yet woman though meeksoul d wife
and babe claim prayer tear
tender bud earli summer time
ere breezi wood verdant prime

her mongst rest barter d child
too young sever mother breast
left unnot whilst poor one wild
twixt hope fear still held close prest
unto heart whose throb loud deep
beat alarum infant sleep

but soon master hasten d
with new purchas infant caught
and bid mother heartless scoff
fling away said T good nought
none lumber road
Is long enough tread without load

the mother clasp d babe bitter cri
but rude hand enforc arm
and rough steward held high
laugh aloud alarm
said unto master thi shall

He bound around infant waist line
that fasten d crupper gave
the babe back laugh that end thine
the stay witti slave
the master chuckl move away
she follow anguish dismay

they journey d oer desert neath sky

and soon fellow slave droop d one one

but went onward word plaint

and look d sped along

At eve bent sleep treasur
with eye wept piti love

with blest care watch us
and morn bound babe
and drew mother train

her tender feet soon wound sore
with rough travel weari way
and slight limb oertask d load bore
less lightli burden day day
but natur fail love impart power
To bear step rest hour

ala mother gaze ach eye

with anguish angel draw near
and bare breast fatal spear

she lost sens weari pain
and hot tearless eye still hurri

At last saw babe weaker grow
that soon littl spark life must fade
So spite prayer wild tear flow

and bid onward heedless woe

No rest perfect repos deep
from sweet babe mother love part
befor loud bitter curs sped

there littl dove sit
between arch alon
cut carv old grey stone
and spider oer flit

round round web spun
with still bird look
from among bead dew
set glori sun

So bird look morn
At lark mount sky
and gaze still shi
At new moon scanti horn

and owl fli night
mock ivi tower
hoot midnight hour
down upon height

but littl dove sit
calm arch
In holi morn air
when owl night gone

then bell matin ring
and grey friar past go
into church doubl row
and hear chaunt sing

So seek around

the raven


there sat raven mid pine dark
the pine silent dark morn
rag bird feather rough torn
whet grimi beak upon bark
and croak hoars wood forlorn

blood red sky misti east
low vapour creep bleakli oer hill
the rain soon come plash rill
No sound place bird beast
save hoars croak woodland fill

slimi pool rank rot weed
close pine highway side
No rippl green stagnant tide
where cold still horseleech breed
ugh might bloodi murder hide

pshaw  cold air slow steal tree
scarc rustl moist leav beneath tread
fear breast thu hold breath dread
there health music breez
It sound  ha ha  like sigh dead

what fright yon raven mid pine dark
the pine silent dark around
with neer accomplish d circl ground
ruffl wing rag stark
some halfdead victim hapli hath found

Ho raven thee ll share spoil
thi way methink die game hath trod
Ay broken twig blood upon sod
these thorn sharp well soon end toil
thi bough asid prize  My god




sonnet

ON the death OF the duke OF wellington




the land stood still listen day
and mid hush mani wrangl tongu
forth cannon mouth signal rung
that earth man pass d away
mighti man mani field
roll d back tide battl foe
thu far shall thi billow go
who freedom falchion right nobli wield
like potter vessel smite tyrant
and earth strongest snatch victori crown
upon anvil battleplain
still beat sword ploughshar all past
the glori labour pain
the conqueror conquer d last




yet men wrought fought
cut crimson sword fame gordian knot
and die nation wonder d forgot
but man name shall circl sun
and children children feel glow
that ripen unconsci men
ask upturn d face what
one answer quicken d heart shall flow
thi man submerg d doer deed
toil d duti fame took heed
hew d name upon great world side
In sureaim d stroke nobl worth
and never time devast tide
shall wear steadfast record earth




thi duti known done men prais
Is thing hero utterli
Or claim aught O man thee
amid sweat grime work day
stand forth thou conqueror god throne
thou ruler thou earthlead great strong
behold thi work thi labour d long
befor mighti presenc littl grown
stand forth thou man low toil mid lee
that measurest duti poor degre
are deed besid deed heaven
but sand upon ocean shore
which softli breath d god wind driven
into dim desert thenceforth seen




then make thou life heroic O thou man
though earth eye still heaven see
each task accomplish d poor degre
but fain work duti plan
the hewer drawer land
No whit behind mighti great
bear unmov burden state
alik duti challeng man hand
life built smallest atom
pile upon pile rampart still increas
and roman wall oer scorn
the scoffer leapt soon held world bay
So shall thi deed duti lowli born
Be thi strong tower glori ere set day





the passagebird


far far away land sea
when winter come cold cold breath
and chill flower sleep death
far far away land sea
like band spirit passagebird flee

round old grey spire even calm
No circl sportiv glee
hear hum vesper psalm
and swell organ far
but far far away land sea
In still midair swift passagebird go

over earth scarc seen
through curtain vapour wave
oer citi hamlet oer hill plain
oer forest green oer mountain hoar
they flit like shadow pass shore
and wing way oer pathless main

there rest weari wing
No quiver bough feet cling
To north south east west
the ocean lie heav breast
within without rest

the tempest gather beneath far
the windgod ride battlecar
and roar thunder lightningflash
break wave sullen crash
but silenc reign passagebird fli
and oer stretch clear blue sky

the day wear starri night
hush world sleep sleep
the dewshow fall still moonlight
and none wake save weep
but rustl starri night
like band spirit passagebird flee
cleav dark sea
swift straight arrow flight
Is wind guid trackless sky
for landmark travel

the first faint streak morn glow
like feebl blush bud rose
and long grey line cloud divid
and march away retreat night
whilst bright gleam victori light
follow goldenli far wide
and mist pass d away
and left heaven seren clear
As eye never shed tear
and univers bask smile day
dreami still sleepi breez
lazili move oer glassi sea
the passagebird flit oer disc noon
like shadow across mirror face
for journey wane apac
and realm summer ll enter soon

the land loom far water blue
the land promis land rest
through cloud storm travel d true
and joy thrill throb breast
down sink wheel flight
whilst song bird come float high
and pass lark sunni sky
but without paus fli
their travel summer shine bright

AN episod


autumn went faintli fli oer land
trail golden hair along west
weep find wave field despoil d

and winter grim came stalk north
around coast rough blast began blow
and toss sea giant sport
lurk without catch unwari sail
and snap belli seam mast
So guy lay idli wait port
gaze eastward stormi mist
gaze eastward morn close eve
seek break amid hurtl cloud
but mani day wind strongli blew
keep bark close moor d within bay
jerk cabl like restiv steed
and wait thu impati gone
look seaward drip wharf
strang rumour fill d ear inland come
how land around nativ place

most terribl see pass strong
they told slew man brute

and lay wast land mani mile
and t thought blade mortal wrought

and told lord king

that whosoe slay noisom beast

and honour d greatli rescu land

yet none found stout heart limb
To ventur peril empriz

If famou guy man

but speed away franc
bear land strength faith

and still east wind bluster d shore

now guy whose ear still tingl day
with strang murmur troubl land
began feel heart piti move
and soul still fret delay
like leash d hound scent fli game
He straight resolv take quarrel
and countri weal slay beast

So aros girt trusti sword
and bow quiver slung behind
and belt mighti battleax
rode calmli forth slay hurt beast
and man knew guy
believ far away foreign shore
which pleas pass well becaus said
thing phoelic king
and none shall know heaven see deed
but countri feel return joy
her heart flutter secret thought

and land desol wast
the field stood rot neath autumn rain
and man pluckt sodden corn lay
dead ripe along furrow mid weed
No cattl brows upon long rank grass
Or paus gaze upon rode
the cottag desert hast
stood opendoor d rift wind
with cold grey ash scatter d oer hearth
here beheld home meal spread forth
which man ate upon floor
An oerturn d cradl whenc mother late
had snatch d babe cri fled

and heart sore saw
for met none wish god speed
So spurr d onward swifter place
where lurk d monster thu spoil d land
and long road seem d wrath
At last came unto fear spot
mark d blanch bone man beast
thicket plant lone heath
oergrown brambl unwholesom weed
that clasp tree around witchlik arm
poison d life still held dead
and one side stretch d stagnant pool
unstirr d grate breez thick
with slimi leav rush forlorn
and everi footstep spongi bank
fill d straightway ooz decay
the beast hid bosom wood
and guy went saw two eye fire
burn dark wood like blast
sent smith forg suddenli night
but nought dismay d bent bow steel
and sent arrow whir leav
He heard shaft ring monster rib
and backward leap falchion strike
full warrior casqu fieri forc
whereat roar horribl hear
like stormwind belch cavern mouth
forth rush d monster furiou grim
with open jaw reek breath guy
who leap nimbl back put forth strength
and struck full eye blow
that made stout axe quiver hand
but noth hurt madden d beast rush d
and nigh oerwhelm d headlong cours
dent breastplat wrought temper d steel
with close homethrust point horn
but guy swift wheel round snort steed
thought phoelic mighti strength
launch d forth stroke made thick blood flow
In loathsom torrent gape wound
So cheer d heart thunder d blow blow
till bellow despair pain
the monster tore earth writh die

and guy saw slain beast
He right glad full sweet content
and wipe bloodstain d battleax
and rode lighten d heart hast away
To bear welcom tide town
and pass d dreamt saw
It seem d though land bloom d
and sunshin fill d air hope life
and bore tide town
and peopl heard beast dead
they gather d round tear cri joy
and scarc found word thank honour
and one brought forth babe held
and cri look child upon soul
may know fashion nobl man

but still told man guy

and desir lead king
but would turn d anoth way
nay friend said need recompens
for worthi deed
lie honour man seek
and thu turn d away unto sea
and would tarri prayer tear
and came unto quiet port
He said word unto wait men
but gaze seaward wave
the cloud fast break west wind blew
and mani sail sped swiftli oer main
white sunshin seagul wing
and went shipboard cheerili
and hove anchor right goodwil
and spread canva welcom breez

and guy stood silent dip bow

that mock thee murki haze
soon morn shall end doubt strife
and give unto thi weep eye
the far nightguard paradis





dirg


wind sigh round droop eav
sadli float midnight hour away
dun grey athwart ivyleav
fall first pale chilli tint day
Ah weari weari tint day

soon dark past gone
soon silenc spread noiseless wing
sleep strike tent hurri
life commenc weari wander
Ah weari weari wander

not sigh lone heart
not heavi griefcloud hang oer
not silenc night depart
gloom hang oer ever evermor
Ah dark ever evermor





TO MY dreamlov


where art thou oh beauti afar
seek thee sadli till day done
and oer splendour set sun
cold calm silveri float even star
where art thou Ah art thou hid light
that haunt yet still wrap thee sight

not wholli ah wholli still love eye
trace thi dim beauti mystic veil
like young moon glimmer faint pale
At noontid sunweb sky
but ah ope mine arm thou art gone
and memori know thou hast shone

night night tender compassion
bind thee gemlik amid raven hair
dream see feel thou art
and stand weep sleep golden gate
till leav open glori stream
down tranc soul radiant dream

too short short soon come chilli morn
To shake love bough sleepborn bloom
and wake heart back bitter doom
send land downcast forlorn
whilst thou beauti art far away
bear bright joyless day

stand gaze across earth fairest sea
and still plash restless main
sound like clash prison chain
that bind oh beauti thee
Oh seabird flash past snowwhit wing
bear soul thi wander

My heart weari gaze oer sea
oer long dreari line close sky
through solemn sunset ever mourn
gaze vain beauti thee
hear sullen wave evermor
dash around lone shore

but tide creep lazili sand
wash frail landmark lethelik away
and though record perish day day
still stand ever close clasp hand
gaze far westward oer heav sea
gaze vain beauti thee





night scene


the light fade littl casement
As though close eye brought night
and dream Ah dream suprem bright
while silenc reign around roof basement
and slow moon mount sky
draw heaven myriad queenli train
fling rich largess pass
Of beauti freeli hill plain

around lattic creep pure white rose
and one light bough rest gentli pane
the diamond pane angel train
gaze sister saint repos
the moonlight silver softli oer
and round eav south wind whisper lowli
wave leav like curl maiden brow
the peac still make place seem holi

the littl garden daili stray
sleep like precinct place enchant
and mani flower dear hand plant
wave mystic neath starri ray
there strang still beauti spot
that misti moonshin oft seem
vision wake eye see
but fair plesaunc bloom dream

the dew distil perfum richli rise
and float unseen silent air
breath balmi sweet everywher
like blest secret fresh paradis
upon soul dim thought eden press
within still inner shrine
where natur unveil d loveli
and angel bare soul divin

there sound upon ear night
the distant watchdog bay hath sunk rest
the thrush brood oer quiet nest
and light cloud sweep noiseless flight
O heart beat wildli hear
and start slumber seren surpris
away away longer linger
To mar silenc thi swell sigh





sonnet


O cloud golden steal oer sky
like pensiv thought across virgin mind
scarc sadder sunshin left behind
would oer heaven thee soul could fli
scan earth beauti lover eye

their sleepi shade silent solitud
where summer long lie
O cloud golden steal oer sky
sail d within thi bosom oer heaven main
methink gaze downward glori
the liquid loveli sea plain
Of mountain isl leafi promontori
My soul would melt fall rain





float down the river


My littl bark glide steadili along
still unshaken summer dream
and never fall oar stream
for t morn current strong
So let rippl bear
sweet sweet life everi sound song
sorrow lie sleep joy send still
swift float river

bright shine sun athwart lindentre

with glow petal midst rest
like gold shower dana love breast
and tall rush cluster side
Ho sweetlipp d lili thou must prize
thu shall pluck thee thi beauti pride
fail d steadili shallop hie
swift float river

the stream fast widen upon shore
rise busi hamlet mid fall wood
fill shorn broken solitud
with labour clamour ever
No dream love day
rich set music forest hoar
now gaili speed untoss d bark away
swift float river

let take oar turn mine eager prow
back quiet waveless sourc
where harsh sound break dream brain
and wind steal softli round careless brow
swift dream tini bark hath gone
and stoutli though pli oar yet
My weari shallop still goe sadli
swift float river

Ah never Ah never
return bless morn hour
the sun beat hotli throb brain
and cool shade wave friendli shore
My feebl oar dip powerless utterli
and onward onward though struggl sore
still goe bark toward surg sea

welcom art thou O cool fragrant eve
welcom art thou though night pursu thee fast

about land wander forlorn
about land sorrowquench eye
seek love among silent wood
seek fountain stream
call name unto lone mountain top
send fli cloud heaven
drop tear amid dew morn
troubl night prayer sigh
that like veil thick set golden star
hideth woe silenc
yet never morn noon night
cometh answer back eurydic
thi voic speak never eurydic
O far deathstricken lost eurydic

hearst thou weari cri eurydic
hear answer past
wrapp d thi robe everlast light
round accent flutter faintingli
like lark slow pant upward sun
Or roll golden sand day away
and never voic despair
trickl among oer thine unmov ear
though everi grove doth multipli sound
and land sigh forth eurydic

My heart untam evermor
the string hang loos warp d evermor
the rock resound olden song
nor melt echo tranc breez
the stream flow music
the magic lyre hath pass d away
for love neer sweep sweet music chord
for thou art pass d away eurydic
thou tuner song eurydic
and nought guid er tone
that breath d thee eurydic
that made breez sweet eurydic
and taught fountain run stream
To sing thee O lost eurydic

the serpent saw thee O eurydic
the serpent slew thee O eurydic
steal amongst grass eurydic
the long rank grass stretch briarian arm
To clasp thee eurydic
and soon laid thee sight men
laid thee beneath rankli wave grass
open earth portal wide let thee wend
forth plutonian realm gloom away
and never wait land
stray d thi light step morn shadi eve
No fountain hid thine imag heart
No flower leapt wreath thi golden hair
No fawn within forest glade
follow d foot lightsom
the moon stole night dim surpris
and star look d pale wonder
for thou camst O lost eurydic
earth found thee O lost eurydic
love found thee O lost eurydic

could stay thou wert forlorn
could live O lost eurydic
not acheron could fright back
from thi footstep wander d best belov
and sought thee een hade gate
charm d wide leav melodi woe
and dare grave keep thine arm
flow d away upon stream song
een dark pluto grimli guard throne
melt cruel cerberu
the parca snakelock d eumenid
To piti measureless despair
sang thi beauti O eurydic
sigh d love forth O eurydic
with tear weari sigh eurydic
and thi name pain hell grew light
ixion wheel stopp d weari round
the rock sisyphu forgot roll
and draught comfort flow d oer tantalu
then old di hand key slipp d
and word hope piti spake forth
He promis thee would go
never backlook realm gloom
those realm gloom thou wert best belov

how could leav thee thu eurydic
without one look one glanc eurydic
and perchanc gaze thee
snare fatal falsehood thi side
yet strove hard length came
where leth flow d faint dim
Ye god could cross love
that might wash memori aye
that live dream
that live love never
that sing eurydic
that leav grip hell
nor bear forth een wing thought
and turn d gaze eurydic
turn d clasp thee O eurydic
and lo thi form straightway dissolv away
thi beauti light dissolv away
and hade thing dissolv away
until found thi cold cold grave
amid grass would grew oer
clasp us close within one narrow home
where might wake find thee gone
the earth ope unto frantic cri
the portal close thee evermor
els melt hell prayer
and born thee back earth triumphantli

cri heartstricken proserpina
rent rock around endless prayer
told stori love
launch d sorrow woman heart
sought barren wintertim
the woful wintertim earth
and Oh thought soul soon relent
and rush crystal torrent eye
till joy sympathet tear
she woo love pluto stoni heart
wait question d long spring
question d everi flower bud spray
If thou didst come among back
conjur bright blossom green leaf
that leav earth bear fullarm d di
but backward flingeth ere glad return
that everi step gloriou liberti
fall upon flower throughout happi land
but never came respons eurydic
the flower dumb O lost eurydic
they would see thee spring earth like
outshin fainter loveli
and left lorn despair
she left lorn O fals proserpina
and never may behold thee
In spring summer O eurydic
By day night O lost eurydic

they shall keep thee O belov
di shall keep thee O belov
but shall shake gate despair
until open wide let pass
ll take life like mighti rock
and beat breach wall time
ll cast exist like wrestler robe
and suppl nake soul throw fate
ll snap shackl whose promethean link
bind soul unto narrow earth
dost hear voic dim float thee
along wave rippl feet
thu come thee eurydic
through wave waterflood eurydic
come come belov eurydic





the sculptor


the dream fell one calm summer night
steal amid wave corn
that wait golden harvest morn
the dream fell still moonlight

the land lay silent new mown hay
rest upon like dreami sleep
and steal softli oer yellow heap
the nightbreez bore sweet incensebreath away

the dew lay thick upon unstirr d leav
the glowworm glisten d brightli pass d
the thrush still chaunt swallow fast
hie home beneath lone cottag eav

He stray land day
dream beauti dream love
and earth beneath heaven
In mirror d glori spirit lay

and went everi sight sound
from silenc sweet air
from earth heaven natur everywher
gleam d forth deep dim thought clasp d round

the thought oppress d weari joy
seek ever perfect shape
that eager eye would still escap
flatter onward hope destroy

He sought bosom hill
He sought silenc wood
their sunni nook shadi solitud
He sought fountain rill

He watch d star come faintli sky
and upturn d brow clear moon shone
flood heart like pale endymion
but still thought hid dimli eye

it voic came even breez
that flutter d faintli summer dream
He heard flow stream
He heard softli rustl tree

yet still thought murmur d heart
He found anywher land
neer saw spirit shape stand
though natur seem d prone start

and thu wander d homeward dream still
Of beauti haunt
with mystic mean shadowi dim
By woodland meadow vale hill

He wander d homeward muse mood
stay d slow step besid marbl block
hewn far unstain d italian rock
that shape chisel wait stood

then heart spoke not alon
thi thought divin hide stream wood
seek express solitud
perchanc een lie unhewn stone

It may soul fill space
and speak us thing see
In word ever mysteri
within parian hath restingplac

He gaze dream dim twilight
and inner sight marbl grew
clear transluc gaze
mystic shape form d wonder sight

that seem d imprison d parian cell
seek vain releas utter
for evermor upward beam glanc
frame word lip could never tell

the vision pass d still unseen power
It stirr d within heart night day
and swift hew prison wall away
the sculptor toil d lovestrengthen d hour

He wrought patienc length amaz
beheld mystic form perfect stand
releas beauti artist hand
He scarc knew wonder d gaze

It love form whose lift arm
yearn d toward heaven radiant frame
As though soul within wing flame
Up earth would waft angel charm

but still one touch retain d ground
So love beam d eye
flow d evermor toward distant sky
and yet earth shape remain d spellbound

the dream fell one calm summer night
and thu fair form still heavenward turn
etern aspir endless yearn
stood thought gladden d sight
