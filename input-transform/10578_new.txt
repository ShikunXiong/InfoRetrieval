phantasi etc




Ma poi ch fui appi un coll giunto
La ove terminava quella vall
che avea di paura il cuor compunto
guarda alto e vidi le sue spall
vestit gia de raggi del pianeta
che mena dritto altrui per ogni call

dell inferno cant






To My father




take first fruit father thi care
wrap fresh leav gratitud
late wake earli gift ill understood
claim harvest right share
whether song mount joy air
prais god yet deeper mood
sit dumb know speechless good

hidden life


proudli youth manhood sudden crown
went walk hors plough
for first time morn No soldier gay
feel side throb gold hilt
know blue blade hide within sheath
As lightn cloud delight
when first belt day
heard still clank ploughchain
the hors har side field
they went make fruit oer hill
the sun look baptiz toil

farmer son grandson
yea greatgrandsir possess field
tradit said till men
who bore name long centuri ago
and marri wive rear stalwart race
and die went follow
save one old man daughter youth
who plough pride ever doubt toil
and death far sunni morn
whi think death life high
the earth laugh day sleep night
earth give us food grave
for good better time

the youth knew littl read old tale
Of scotland warrior till blood ran swift
As charg knight upon death career
and chant old tune till blood
wa charm back fountainwel
and tear aros instead and robert song
which ever flow nois like name
rose field besid kine
and met skylark rain cloud
As yet sang sing bird
from glad simpli knew
the earth fair knew fair
and glad knew glad
He walk twilight sens
which one day shall turn tender light

for ere sun clear featheri top
Of firthicket eastward hill
hi hors lean labour hi great hand
held rein ploughstilt proud
proud ploughman pride nobler may
than statesman ay poet pride sometim
for littl prais would come plough well
and yet well proud work
and would follow with sure eye
He saw hors keep arrowtrack
He saw swift share cut measur sod
He saw furrow fold right
readi nimbl foot aid need
and slain sod lay patient grain
turn secret upward sun
and hide grave green sunborn grass
and daisi clip carmin must die
that other live aris

then sun clomb declin
and seem rest slow descent
upon keyston airi bridg
they rest likewis halftir man hors
and homeward went food courag new
wherebi refresh turn toil
and live labour afternoon
till gloam plough
lay like strand bark upon lea
and home hang neck hors went
walk besid master forc
then deepen shade vision came

It ladi mount hors
slender girl upon mighti steed
that bore pride hors must feel
when submit women home went
alon els groom lag far behind
but pass faithless belt gave way
the saddl slip hors stop girl
stood feet still hold fast rein

three pace bore bound side
her radiant beauti almost fix
but main forc one gripe fear
He threw fascin saw
the work soon hand knife
replac saddl firmer
upon gentl hors turn
To mount maiden but bewilder
moment last knew
with stirruphand steadi arm throne
elast steed ascend maid
moment yet thank
nor yet time teach
around waist put brawni hand
that almost zone round like child
lift high set hors
whenc like risen moon smile
nor turn away although radiant blush
shone cheek shadow eye
but never sure heart
Or rosi sunset came flush
again thank stood
bewild beauti not word
answer word flow fold tone
round dissolv lambent music play
like drop water silver cup
till round shoulder neighbour hill
sudden disappear and awok
and call hard name turn went
after hors bend head

Ah god beauti pass door
although neer came hous grow bare
shut shut door noth hous
whi seem alway
secret lie behind thou dost know
and partli guess

but think
the holder plough mani sigh
upon bed night dream
than pleasant rose upon view sleep
within magic crystal soul
nor airi castl brain
had less foundat air admit
but read simpl tale scarc worth name
and answer gain fair
beauti best gift prove sooth
An angel vision higher world

not much tell her chang life
where part water mountain ridg
flow side apart
her tale hath wile deep sigh summer eve
where ancient mysteri wood
walketh man worship womanhood
soon orphan parenthaunt
surround dead glitter shine
Of leav wind sunlight youth
breath constant break dawn
sent forth newborn wind upon brow
and knew morn light climb
the hillsid morn light
they say reveal inner hue earth
now god made ere
the world tri spoil tri say
and halfsucceed fail utterli
fair frank innoc child
that stare eye fearless ill
becaus knew brave withal
becaus drank draught maketh strong
the charm countri air her father hous
scottish laird ancient name
stood two mile amid hill
but though often pass alon
the youth never seen face
and might twice yet enough
It left she harvest moon
that goeth way knoweth
the field grain whose ripen ear fill
with wealth life human joy
went knew influenc
she left behind yea never thought
save time old scene
return uncal wonder come
amidst far thought care
sink ancient grave
till farwhisp necromant spell
loos wander space

again say fond romanc love
No argument possibl
If one claim aid
turn clear brain nest dream
As soon sat twist cord
To snare carri home daylight use
some womanangel wander halfseen
On moonlight wing oer wither autumn field
but rose next morn went abroad
the exult newfound rank
alreadi settl digniti
He found earth beauti the sky
which shone expect sun
somehow knew like face
He griev almost plough daisi
someth share common smile
wherewith crown manhood fell
bent furrow sometim head
just imploringli hedgehog ran
with tangl mesh bristl spike face
helplessli innoc across field
He let run bless ran
At noon return someth drew feet
into barn enter gaze stood
through rent roof alight one sunbeam
blaze upon straw one golden spot
dull yellow heap sank far
like flame invert loosepil mound
cross splendour shadowstraw
In line innumer T bright
the eye cheat spectral smoke
that rose fire He never knew
befor beauti sunlight
though seen grassi field
and river ripen corn
thousand time He threw heap
and gaze glorygulf
dream boy halfsleep fire
and dream rose got hors

god woman heart
but priestess visibl earth
hold key beauti
had come flung portal wide
He enter beauti glass
that gleam woman back upon view

alreadi hour grow soul
put forth white tip floral bud
ere long crownlik shadowi flower
for song joy ancient tale
He show seed lay hidden heart
safe sure treasur hidden even
and notwithstand mellow spring
until like sunshin genial power
came fair maiden face seed awok
need follow mani day
nor tell joy rose around path
minist pleasur labour meed
nor morn boon
nor wind natur kiss fraught
flow inward soul flower
assert individu life
separ thought
nor stormi day interven
call forth strength song quell forc
nor wintertim thick snow
arm sad field gnaw frost
and low sun skirt far realm
and sank earli night took place
besid fire feebl lamp
head book book live live
and need clime
and ad be thu
but must tell love knowledg grew
within passion power
till night dark except moon
shone frosti oer lea white snow
gave back mote light els sunk
into thirsti earth bent way
over moor littl town
lay gather hollow there man
who taught children shorten day
taught scholar long forenight
and youth shop barn
Or loom done need work
came schoolroom murki night
and found fire aglow candl lit
and good master wait men
here mathemat wile height
and strang consent line form law
made euclid like great romanc truth
the master saw wonder youth
all eagerli devour offer food
and straightway long lead hope
Of sympathi urg know
To multipli great knowledg gift
that two soul ere long may see one truth
and turn see other face shine
So propos classic youth
caught offer mani night
when other lay lost sleep
He grope way lexicon rule
through ancient deed embalm latin old
Or poetwood aliv graciou form
wherein knowledg english tongu
through read mani book much aid
for soul languag
At length progress master word
proud pupil reach father ear
great joy aros within vow
If care spare would accomplish
He colleg fill
Of learn

So school went
instead plough ere year
He wore scarlet gown close sleev

awkward first digniti
that soon found fit embodi speech
and gestur address made way
not seek respect youth
In respect rarer gift
likewis consent accid
more worth societi call
In great northern citi room
invit He enter dazzl first
not brillianc show
In light mirror gem crowd eye
but surfac light mani mind
cut like rosediamond mani plane
which catch wander ray fact
reflect colour toss
In vari brillianc quit newborn
from centr face
dazzl first say soon began
To see littl thought could sparkl well
and turn even midst talk
back silenc home toil
around still ever hung air
born field plough cart scyth
kind clumsi grace gay girl
saw clumsi light
instead glitter quiet eye
saw grace yea sometim talk
saw grace began last
As sought none seek crowd
after maiden fashion might
hear dress thought pay poor compliment
yet seldom thu seduc toil
Or one eve window show light
the next faintli gleam candleshin
till far morn and
honour among first session close

and increas familiar
with open form ill shun
where youth kind meet endang
mind will pure
oft broad rich humour jest
did breezi forc make radiant way
for pestilenti vapour follow
aros within sudden silent mind
the maiden face smile blush
that ladi face inspher beyond earth
yet visibl star
that shine unwav tell
In word tender glow across
hi bosom burn clean thought
shall sweet face blown laughter rude
out soul deign come
but stay maiden may hear
He almost wept shame two thought
should ever look face
meet his hous thu made
for love offer puriti

and homag sometim found
new countri lad convey smile
assent silent listen spoke
threaten yet life simplic
An antidot natur ever came
even natur self for summer month
hi former haunt boyhood circumst
receiv back within old influenc
and nobl despis past
too proud asham manhood toil
too wise fanci gulf lay wide
betwixt labour hand think brain
Or workman gentleman
becaus workman cloth
In old garment took hoe spade
Or sow sheet cover grain
smooth harrow plough ridg
with ever fresher joy hail field
return still larger power sight
each time knew better
and yet sweetest aspect old
hi labour kept true life fact
cast worldli judgment fals desir
and vain distinct ever toil
new thought aros still night awok
He ever sought like star instrument
By scienc wise philosophi
bridg gulf known
and thu prepar come month
when time snow old scotland son
reap wisdom silenc year

hi sire proud
becaus learn make proud
wise man build much upon lore
the neighbour ask would make son
ll make man old man said
and rest like
but son think
He ll keep old farm join old name
and shall go churchyard content
leav name amongst fellow men
As safe thank god bore still
but son older sire full oft
In new world cometh

So four year long life went fro
betwixt scarlet gown rough blue coat
the garret studi widefloor barn
the wintri citi sunni field
In quiet mind well content
becaus where

not one channel flow seek thought
To profess ardent turn
He knew father wish
whi man said knowledg grow
leav therefor old patriarch life
and seek distinct nois men
and yet turn face everi side
went doctor lectureroom
and saw inner form man laid bare
went chymist skil hand
rever law higher natur self
make natur eye
and moment mani year
and veil vast lone deep
she laboureth alway best content
when man inquir secret way
yea turn ask eye everi sourc
whenc knowledg floweth heart men
kneel drink freeli
and end gain right
To sit cover head rank
Of blackgown senat men
were readi word speed
proud pupil toward goal
where might fix eye took book
what littl gown cap remain
and leav sigh ancient wall
with old stoni crown unchang grey
amidst blandish airi spring
He sought life lone ancestr farm

with simpl glad met road
hi greyhair father elder brother
few word spoken littl welcom said
but much understood either side
If less delight brought home
than met prodig return
yet confid certain joy
and lean pride old men feel
In young strong arm draw might
He led hous hi sister
whose kiss mani whose eye
were full watch hover love
set besid fire old place
and heap tabl best countri fare
and night grew deep father rose
and led son wonder went
and dark made tortuou path
through cornrick old loft
the stabl hors rest still
enter saw planpursu hand
had work the father lead
across floor heap wait grain
open door An unexpect light
flash cheer lamp fire
that burn alon fairi tale
and lo littl room whitecurtain bed
An old armchair bookshelv write desk
and old print deep virgilian wood
and one countri churchyard wall
the young man stood spoke the old love
seek find incarn new
drew heart earth sun
warm tear the good fatherli old man
honour son simpl need
which bounti begot
thu gave loneli silent thought
simpl refug could call
He grasp hand shook said good night
and left glad love faintli beneath
the hors stamp drew lengthen chain

three slide year gentli blend chang
went round mid work hand brain heart
He labour though would
with privileg took hour toil
when noth press read within room
Or wander moorland hill
there stood upon apex world
with great altarston rock beneath
and look wide abyss blue
that roof round steadi foot
descend world worthi care

and sunday father daughter son
walk countri church across field
It littl church plain almost
To ugli yet lack charm
To sat littl boy
and low mound long grass wave
were quit solemn great marbl tomb
and sunni afternoon across
thi wellsown field death forth came
with last psalm still linger heart
He look wonder heap would rise
that rest arch dead breast
but gloom rain turn asid
and let drop soak sink clay
what matter

and walk
togeth home father love hear
the new stream pour son clear well
the old man clung old
nor bow young man new
yet walk full often would say
He like much heard morn
He said men believ past alon
honour jewish time jew
and ear poor needi hour
that centuri doth go
like beggar boy wander street
with hand held passer
and yet god made mani cri

He use say take work come
all readi hand the lever set
grasp heav withal Or rather
love live yield
that made need It may
find nearer need work
than choic would choos
To lack relish thing god
think worth among good
helper look
thi farm god much yonder town
these men maiden kine hors
and need law truth made rule fact
Or els earth redeem ill
He spoke often rule
No ill suffer man beast
that could help creatur fled
and slew t sudden death
like god benign lightn for knew
that god doth make beast love well
and sacr sprung god
they brethren lower kind
and face saw human look
they said men look like differ anim
but the anim like men
some one anoth cruelti
He said would need fieri hell
than ghost sad beast come
and crowd silent head one way
stare ill man mad

By degre
they knew men trust when
He spoke word forc deed
that lay unsaid within To good
Is holi word definit act
embodi unconsci
In simpl form human help
and understand need pray
and read weari tale crime
and wretched whitefac children sad
with hunger neglect cruel word
He would walk sadli afternoon
with head downbent ponder footstep slow
and conclud the best
for great world best
for world the influenc go
In widen circl darksom lane
In london self when philanthropist
said pompous with great gift ought
To work great world spend
On common labour like common man
He answer the world god hand
thi part give past
built love inherit hath made
Me fittest neither He let think
primev godlik work low need
for perfect manhood noblest power
and deepest knowledg far beyond gift
and crowd men soul
cri window hollow eye
for bare human leav grow
would could help but crowd made
Of individu grief pain
and thirst hunger one
not mani and power help
enter individu extend
thenc thousand gentl influenc
To heart It made one
By lay hold allot share
Of gener good divid faith
now labour whole upon place
where known childhood

Of humbl day necess
would alway conscious good
not alway feel helper men
who make full return poor deed
which must highest sake
If forgot brethren
By human trust confid eye
that look face hand
My work t deserv
but citi lame word
and scanti hand weak coin
misunderstood best unknown
toil seldom reach mail
and leav thing lieth next
To go thing afar

what vision vision fair
sent forth meet eve went
home first day plough oft pass
slowli horseback kind dream
for much dream love dream well
nor woke dream vain regret
but say seen face
He smile eye rose work

and sometim thought one day wed maid
and make mine never came maid
Or never came hour might say

Of histori spoke woman fair
Or wondrou good face aros stay

beneath dark blue vault ablaz star
and lift full eye earth radiant roof
In glad roof yet floor

Or emerg vision might reveal

and knoweth god good fair faith
who needeth outward show thing
but worship unconquer truth
and man loveth proud
and humbl would love knew

In third year heavi harvest fell
full fill beneath reapinghook scyth
the men maiden scorch heat
held toil lighten song jest
rest midday brim bowl
drink brown ale white abund milk
until last ear fell stubbl stood
where wave forest murmur corn
and oer land rose pile tentlik shock
As armi rest array
Of tent tent rank follow rank
wait moon
Of ripen ear

and went well
the grain fulli ripe the harvest cart
went forth broadplatform tower load
with frequent passag twixt homeyard field
and half oat alreadi hid top
Of countless sprayhung grain top wind
sway oft ring rustl contact sweet
made heavi oft slowcombin dew
Or beaten earthward pelt rain

and bear thing till perfect time
had hid say growth sun air
within dark tower stack
when north low billowi cloud appear

and west dark mass plash blue
with outlin vagu misti steep dell
clomb oer hilltop thunder

downward went sun
down low behind low sullen cloud
that wall west hill
that lay beneath hid upros moon
and look silenc mooni field
but found the stagger cart
like oerladen beast crawl homeward still
return light low the laugh broke yet
that lightn soul cloudless sky
though frequent labour pass

Of huge raincloud heavi flood
sleep like enchantress old soon side
the crawl cloud flung benumb spell
On man hors the youth guid home
the ponder load sheav higher wont
dare slumber lightn start
awok fall full wheel
that circl slow sleepi hors
yet none would yield softsuggest sleep
Or leav last shock wild rain
would catch therebi skirt harvesthom
and hold linger halfway storm

the scholar labour men night
not favour quit headlong race
with natur He would rather say the night
Is sent sleep ought sleep
and leav cloud god not everi storm
that climbeth heavenward overwhelm earth
and god will t better will
what take us never lost
but old farmer order son
went man work held peac

the last cart homeward went oppress sheav
just moist dawn blot pale east
and first drop fell overf mist
oergrown helpless darker grew morn
upstrain rack cloud tumultu born
upon turmoil oppos wind
met zenith and silenc ceas
the lightn brake flood earth
and great roar billow follow
the deeper dark drank light
and lay unslak but ere dark came
In full revel flash
He saw along road born hors
power gentl sweet ladi go
whom year agon saw evermor
Ah said dream come
now shall time and home went
and slept moan woke rave wept
through netdrawn labyrinth brain
the fever rage like pent intern fire
hi father soon hand
Of one sister sooth day went
As summer even rain
He woke sweet quiescent conscious
enfeebl much newborn life

As slow week pass recov strength
and ere winter came seem strong
but brown hue health return
On thin face although keener fire
burn larger eye cheek
the mount blood glow radiant summon forc
sometim unbidden sunset red

befor time bite frost set
and gnaw fang cold shrink life
and diseas common north
wa born outer cold inner heat
one morn sister enter saw slept
but hand held handkerchief

stood motionless stare startl next
By pallor rais eye
seen glass move last He woke
and see dismay said smile
bloodr evermor favourit hue
and see

and hour look death full face

when first saw red blood outward leap
As sought fountain heart
whenc flow fill golden bowl
No terror wild excit seiz
hi spirit ponder mysteri
Of unseen would fling portal wide
and would enter one aw dead
whom men conceiv ghost fleet pine
bereft weight half valu live
but knew must live intens life
have matter illum sens
flame like horeb bush present soul
and contact thousand soul
each present glori shape
suck much honey flower world
and kept gain cast mean asid
and eye ear sens perhap

So like child wait show
while yet pant light restrain burn
At half height theatr full

but day went brought sad hour
when would sit hand upon knee

Ah learn new necess

and cast distort shadow soul
while poor soul yet complet god
can inward light burn shade
and laugh seem fact
for god speak man everi side
send voic outer world

and inner world thing unseen
In hope thought deep assur
not seldom ceas outward speech awhil
that inner isl calm may clearer sound
Or call dull storm proclaim rest
one centr fix amid conflict sphere
and thu soul calm becom
abl meet cope outward thing
which els would overwhelm utterli
and soul say I light

and man glow present god

Ah graciou god
Do us thou wilt thou gloriou heart

Or heapedup ocean still foam

hi soul like frozen lake beneath
the clear blue heaven reflect dim
that could scarc believ heaven
and fear beauti might toy
invent happier mood
for said mind dim fair
whi enhanc fair
but poor mind lay dim

Of strive death life and tire man

To dream fanci flieth free

Of ancient histori sweep sea

Ah heart thou needst anoth god
Oh lack doubt fear come
becaus plenti confid love

Or ancient rainbow dawn west

Go wander dreari hous

In pain rest compel full oft lay still

Lo oer bosom outspread earth

Ah holi midnight soul

It chang wintri time
but visit april air scent
that came sudden presenc unforetold
As brush outer sphere spring
In new sing world wind sigh
that wander swept across glad to be
strang long never knew till
sens want yea infinit need
cri within rather moan cri
and would sit silent hour gaze
upon distant hill dazzl snow
upon peak thenc adown side
streak vapor star solid blue
and shadowi sens aros
As behind worldinclos hill
there sat mighti woman face
As calm life intens
push nigh death wait
To make grand ever kiss
and send silent tone world

the father saw wane the proud sire
beheld pride go droop cold
down warm earth gave god thank
that old but evermor son
look smile heard strang news
across wast primrosebud flower
then father would come
seek comfort troubl child
and child hope comfort
sure one great father heaven
sinc everi word good father lip
falleth author although
they men god speak
So poor son near unknown death
took comfort father tender
and made strong die one day came
and said what think father hard
thi die well boy said We ll tri
and make easi present god
but judg though hope sight
It seemeth harder looker
than dieth It may breath
that would call gasp seem unto
sigh pleasur sob
wherewith uncloth spirit step step
wade forth cool etern sea
think boy death two side
one sunni one dark round earth
Is everi day half sunni half dark
We dark side call mysteri death
they look light
wait glad birth tear
Be near father die said
boy better sire
take hand mine shall say
give back thee Oh love god
for need ever
and son mind near turn
when time come light beyond
and know dark

and day went green
shone snow patch green
for though snow white yet green shone
and hope life awok within heart
for spring drew warm soft bud spring
with promis the father better knew
god give us heaven rememb poor heart
We never grasp zenith time
We find spring except winter prayer

now strode king across field
crept slowli breath spring
and sometim wept secret earth
which dwelt near heart sun
and moon maiden soon would lie afar
across unknown suredivid wast
yet think though fall upon sad
and linger listen faint tone
befor strike new chord seiz old
and waft essenc musicstair

To look blank unknown full void
for hope god growth year

At peac someth deeper still
some sound sigh ever harmoni
with deeper fainter tone still
drew nearer unknown depth wherein

He never thought churchyard
when strong ever look
away green earth blue sky
and thank god die cold
for said would rather go abroad
when sun shine bird happi
for though may shall know place
but mighti realm make thought
not live creation
but evermor creat world
yet still seem go
into sea air float heav
and swing massi wave around earth
and may feel wet uncloth soul
and would rather go full
Of light blueness grey fog
thicken steam old earth
now first summer shall die
ly mayhap sunset sink asleep
and go light dark
and earth dark ll say he dead
but shall say ah god live love
the earth fair fairer still
My dear one dear
the past past dearer still
So shall go starlight may
Or lapt moonlight ecstasi seek
the heart man friend
whom shall know beyond love
becaus make love true deep
and live

the weari day night taught much

To feel god arm around hold close
close heart ere could rest hour
and god good said

Ah god need winter spring
and thi poor children know thi great heart
and thou bearest thi larg share grief
becaus thou lovest good joy
In thou lovest dost let griev

the homeless ghost


still flow music flow wine
the youth silenc went
through nake street cold moonshin
hi homeward way bent
where citi seaward line
hi lattic seaward leant

He knew left throng
but could rest
that someth pain song
and mock jest
and cold moonglitt lay along
one love ladi breast

He sat solemn book
hi sad beguil
skull bracketnook
threw lipless smile
but aw laughtermock look
wa pass moonbeam wile

An hour sat read vain
nought mirror eye
for fro helpless brain
went danc mysteri
till gust wind pane
mix seabird cri
and sudden spatter drift rain
bade mark alter sky

the moon gone intomb cloud
the wind began rave
the ocean heav within shroud
for dark built grave
but like ghost brake forth cri aloud
the white crest wave

big rain the wind howl awar
Of tread wateri west
the window shiver back wave hair
the firesid seem best
but lo ladi sat chair
with moonlight across breast

the moonbeam pass the ladi sat
her beauti sad white
all hair white shone
and hair black night
and eye dark never gone
although full light

but hair wet wept like weed
On pearli shoulder bare
and clear pale drop ran like bead
down arm finger fair
and limb shine like thinfilm seed
her dank white robe despair

she move look wonder face
till blush began rise
but gaze like one veil lace
To someth within eye
gaze place
but thought spirit tri

then voic came forth sweet clear
though jar inward pain
she spoke like one speak fear
Of judgment gain
when soul full mountainmer
and speech flow vein

thine eye like mine thou art bold
nay heap die fire
It warm cold
cold churchyard spire
If thou cover fold fold
thou killst cold dire

her voic beauti like molten gold
thrill burn rain
He fire cold
cold waveless main
but heartwel fill woe till roll
torrent calm

save Oh save cri flung
her splendour feet
weari wander storm among
and hate mouldi sheet
dare dark windvex wrung
not dark dead thing meet

Ah though ghost m ladi still
the youth recoil aghast
with passion sorrow great eye fill
not word white lip pass
He caught hand t cold kill
but held warm fast

what save thee dear
At word sprang upright
To icelip drew burn ear
and whisper shiver whisper light
she withdrew gaze ask fear
He stood face ghostwhit

wait ah would might wait said
but moon sink tide
thou seest see fade
like one may bide
ala go moonless shade
Ah kind let stay hide

He shiver shook felt like clay
and fear went blood
hi face aw ashi grey
and vein channel mud
the ladi stood white dismay
like halfblown frozen bud

Ah speak fright
live though call death
cold say dear
but scarc could heav breath
the air felt dank like frozen fen
and halfconsci wraith

Ah save hopeless cri
that enter heart lay
but sunshin warmth rosi vie
with cold moonlight grey
He spoke she move yet eye
she stood three pace away

she spoke grief face
beauti almost slain
with fever vision unseen pace
she flit away
and stood last dumb prayer grace
By window clang rain

He stood stare she vanish quit
the loud wind sank sigh
grey face without pale face night
As swept window
and pass press cheek fright
To glass stare eye

and afar deep
came long cadenc wail
It rose sank rose steep
Of billow build gale
It ceas bosom creep
low echo tell tale

He open lattic saw afar
over western sea
across spear sparkl star
mooni vapour flee
and thought pang could bar
the ladi might

He turn look room
and lo cheerless bare
empti drear hopeless tomb
and ladi
yet fire lamp drove gloom
As driven fair

and manhood breast
sprang storm passion shame
It tore pride fanci best
In thousand shred blame
It threw ground ancient crest
and puf ancient name

He turn ladi lightli clad
out stormi cold
wa ghost divin sad
are guest hade old
wander ghost Oh terror bad
that refus earthli fold

and sorrow shame regret
into humil wept
He knelt kiss footprint wet
and track thin robe swept
He sat chair icecold yet
and moan slept

He woke dawn the flame sun
laugh byegon dark
glad said night done
and dream slain lark
and eye gun
that boom sunset hark

and sudden invad blast
He knew dream
and night belief held fast
till thin morn beam
thu radiant morn pale night pass
On backwardflow stream

He love ladi heav breath
red lip smile alway
and sigh odour inhabiteth
all rosehu may
but warm bright ladi fals death
and ghost true day

and spiritfac woe divin
came back hour sigh
As men lost aim pine
old face childhood rise
He wept plead voic shine
Of solitari eye

and believ ghost night
and believ day well
and vow sorrow tear might
all ask whate befel
If came room garment white
onc midnight knell

she came He sought churchyard old
that lay along sea
and mani church midnight toll
and moon shone wondrous
and crypt crept grown bold
but wait vain ah

and pine sigh love sore
that look lost
and pray pardon
As one sin
till fade length away wore
and ghost

but found ladi
the ladi sadli lost
Or found mongst live men
love host
know till drop pen
and ghost

and everi lesson learnt anew

So forget child

and O lord yet dare
To clasp thee breast

and yet shrink first
Be thou judg guilt

On wellknown hill lea

when sudden westward rush

and hill clomb came
On flow like sea

No terror woke

for belt tree within

for side doubt dumb
and terror ceas foam
No great seabillow dare come
and tread holi home

two day pass with restless toss

To etern shore

the world fair hope nigh
some men women true
and strong death

and shrank but sweet good
the dream came aid
within tree father stood

My grief mine alon

My life death belong thee

and thou shalt bear tri
To peac child

the rich man mourn littl loss
and knit brow care

and seek relief prayer

To him maketh strong
that return thought care

for ere sleep care redeem

On slow repos wing

and sheepbel babbl round child

By thought vanish gold
but came guardian host
Of flower meek bold

To sooth rest

they said god meant flower He made
As children see

and want hear flower

Of cloudveil upward cast

Of nereid dream past

In night round ladi dream
queen among dream
came silent sunset stream
mix voic stream
silver fountain spring
blossom molten gold
and air bird float ring
through harmoni manifold

she lie water valley
her garden melt away
through footpath curv alley
into wild wood grey
and green vale goe creep
To feet rug hill
where moveless rock keep
the home wander rill

and hue flower grow deeper
till dye brain
and scent like soul sleeper
wander waver rain
for dream wealth glori
that daylight give
Ah god make hope stori
bid dream aris live

she lay gaze flower
till soul garden smile
with blossomoershad bower
great colour splendour wild
and heart fill glad
till could ach
and turn asid sad
As piti sake

and fog came oer meadow
and rich hue faint lay
came wood shadow
came rock grey
and sunset thither vanish
where sunset alway go
and sound stream banish
As slain frost snow

and flower pale fast faster
and crumbl fold fold
till look like stain plaster
Of cornic ruin old
and blacken shrunk togeth
As scorch breath flame
with sad perplex whether

and saw still lie

and smile instead die
wa fix idiot smile
and ladi aros sorrow
out sleep dark stream
but dream made dark morrow
and told haunt dream

ala dear ladi know

that bright thing seem
one moment sad commot
and one doubt wither rule
and great wavepuls ocean
Is gather pool

and flower spot paint
Of lifeless stare hue
though heart sick faint
they say word
and bird know nought glad
they songmachin
and man skil mad
and women pictur queen

and fierc dig fountain
To know water true
and climb crest mountain
To part blue
but look far us
for nigh
though sky lofti oer us
We alway sky

and fog oer rose creepeth
steam unknown sea
In dark soul sleepeth
and sigheth constantli
becaus oer face water
the breath hath gone
and instead glad son daughter

when heart know well father
the eye alway day
but grow dim rather
that light
believ amidst thi sorrow
that blight swath earth
Is shade borrow

god heart fount beauti

If vanish thou thi duti
that necromant spell
and thi heart father cri
will fill water deep
thine eye may say beauti die
but thi spirit she goe sleep

and fear thi fair soul ever
will smile thi imag smile
It fled sudden shiver
and thi bodi lay beguil
let flower thi beauti perish
let go ancient dust
but hope children cherish
they father trust

To enter empti eye

In dead composur cast
As suddenli dream chang

My wander hand oer mound rest

No voic inhabit great space

An unknown grassi place

and stormi sound combin

nor grassi cover divid
from sun moon star

with oft return still surpris
repel sound strife




As one bestrid wild scare hors
beneath stormi moon
and still heart quiet forc

So heart troubl
Be throb breast

O god dost ever rest

when mighti seawind madli blow
and tear scatter wave
As still summer wood

So dream old man soul old

what mean variou thou callest forth
upon face still passiv earth
even like lord music bent

Or strang yellow radianc slant pass
betwixt long shadow oer meadow grass

the lost soul


brother look

what see ye noth yet
knit eyebrow close stare
send soul forth gaze
As fingerpoint set
through thick foggi air
beyond air see dark
for dark hedg still way
and beyond dark oh live away
dim far sure mark
huge worldheap wither year
dropt bough etern
see ye someth lie
shapeless dumb despair
yet someth spirit recognis
with vision dwell eye
It hath form man
As huge mossrock valley green
when light freez began
thicken crystal dark
might look like sleep man
what think ye brother know well
know eye ye see tell

T poor lost soul alack
It aliv age back
one wing might eye
think heard wrote book
but gather life nook
and perish amid mysteri
which choke faith
but proud midst say dark
which god charact wall
and light burn interv
To spent read god saith
He lazili trim spark
and went soul dark

Is aught thee
soul art lie
Is life yet left thee
So thou couldst spare
word reveal mysteri
Of banish light air

ala O soul thou wert
As soul cri thee
thou hadst thi place mystic danc
from door far etern
issu still feet glanc
To music free

ala O soul think
that thou wert made like
with heart love thirst drink
from well feed sea
and hand truth link
twixt mine parent knee
and eye pierc brink
Of thing see

ala ala brother
To thee heart drawn
My soul anoth
In dark amidst dawn
As child eye mother
dead floweri lawn

mourn thee poor friend
spring cliff drop
To drink waysid god would bend
and He found thee broken cup
He threw thee asid hi way wend
further higher

alack sad soul alack
As lay thi grave
feel infinit suck back
the individu life gave
thi spring die pool deep black
which sun pit lave

thou mightst one us
cleav storm fire
aspir faith gloriou
higher ever higher
till world storm look tremul
far like smitten lyre

hundr year might
have dart gloom
like swift angel cross flight
where thundercloud loom
from upcast pinion flash light
Of inward word doom

It heareth brother terribl thing
sound sens ear bring
hath god forgotten ala
lost etern lumber room
will wave spirit never pass
over insens gloom
It lie alon lifeless world
As frozen bud earth lie curl
sightless soundless without cri
On flat vacuiti

Up brother storm nigh
We smite wing steepest sky
through rush air
We climb stair
that heaven vault doth leap
We measur height
By stroke flight
it span tempest sweep
what matter hail clash wind
We know tempest lie
dead pit etern
brother let us strong mind
lest storm beat us back
Or treacher calm sink beneath wing
and lower us gentli track
To depth forgotten thing
Up brother t storm
T storm god victori

after AN old legend


the monk pray cell
and pray full sore
He pray knee
for two long hour

and midst suddenli
He felt eye ope wide
and lift head saw
man feet besid

and almost feet reach
garment strang knit
some woman finger age agon
had trembl make

the monk eye went garment
until hand spi
cut chisel
and anoth scar besid

then eye sprang face
with singl thirsti bound
T He nigh faint
hi eye master found

On ear fell convent bell
that told poor wait
for hand divid daili bread
all conventg

and storm thought within
blew hither thither long
and bell kept call time
with iron merciless tongu

He look master eye
and sprang feet strength
though find come back
shall find length

He went fed poor
all conventg
and like one bereft heavi feet
went back desol

He stood door unwil
To see cell bare
He open door lo
the master stand

wait thee
the poor wait
and stood besid thee time
In crowd conventg



but seem though stori
sayeth word
If monk stay lord would stay
nor crush heart

for faroff time
word sound tenderli
the poor ye alway
and ye alway




the tree S prayer


ala t cold dark
the wind night sung wintri tune
hail black cloud swallow moon
ha beat bark

Oh spring
the sap move within wither vein
through frozen root creep numb pain
that hardli cling

the sun shone last morn
felt warmth everi fibr float
thought heard thrush pipe note
Of hope sad born

then came seacloud driven
the tempest hiss outstretch bough
hither thither toss snow
beneath joyless heaven

O sunni leav
almost forgot breath june
forgot featheri lightflak moon
the pray summerev

O joyou bird
which tongu us mute long tree
O billowi odour bee
abroad scatter herd

the bless cool shower
the grate thrill everi shoot
the children play round deepsunk root
shadow hot noon hour

ala cold clear dawn
through bare latticework twig around
anoth weari day moan sound
On thinshadow lawn

yet winter noon past
ll stretch arm night wind
endur day chill air unkind
My leav will come last




stori OF the seashor


introduct

sought long clear twilight north
when nest tree father hous
see aurora deepen dawn
far northward east oer hilltop
and front splendour northern west
where sunset die ghostli gleam
that round horizon creepeth night
back jubil graciou morn
found home homeli unchang
for love maketh home unchang
receiv right sonship still
O vault summerheaven born hill
onc thou didst embrac child
thi droop ful nourish joy
onc valley pictur forth sigh
rose present vision behold
In noth dream bemock truth
the water ran garrul
the wild flower crowd round welcom feet
the hill aros dwelt alon heaven
and learn new tale came
onc trod wellknown field
whose fatherhood made search god
and old new like wild flower
the water hill dearer far

onc day cousin frank
drove seaward road dear white mare
which oft born lone hill
besid sat maiden whose face
look sinc boy girl
but old friendship straightway bloom anew
the heaven sunni earth green
the harebel larg oh plenti
while butterfli blue danc
born purposeless puls clear joy
In sportiv time aeolian clang
that day talk without restraint
brought near memori day
and therefor ever joy
Of motion warm shine air
By glad sens freedom like thought
and bond friendship dead
she told tale would mould anew
To last form utter

for wander back childish year
and ask knew ruin old
whose masonri descend wave
face seacliff whose rocki feet
the billow fell die along coast
T one child marvel for year
We turn back upon ripen corn
and sought border desert sea
O joy water mingl fear
Of blind forc knew
but spent strength wave lash aye
the rock laugh foam flight

but oh vari rich port
for almost beach wall
inclos reach garden lord
hi shadi walk ancient tree state
hi river cours indefinit
wander across sand without wall
and lost find sea
within float swan white splendour lay
beneath fairi leap wire bridg

Ah sky show higher cloud

whose top circular templ crown
seen far wave wind shore
So becloud ever night
Of luxuri ivi low door
halffil rainbow hue deepstain glass
appear open right hill
never sesam mine door
yield room one undi pane
gaze rever curios
saw littl chamber round high
which see escap heat
and bath cool eye brain
for dark green upon one side
window unperceiv without
block ivi manifold whose leav
like crowd head gazer row row
climb top light came
through thick veil green oh kindest hue
but midst wonder place
against background ivi boss
On low column stood white pure still
womanform marbl cold clear
know may
silenc echo fainter still
but form yet form call
So undefin pale gleam visionlik
In lone treasurechamb soul

then came thought joyou keep joy
turn sad relief
To sit dream long hot summer day

and read read arabian night
till beauti grew possibl
and read everi one
To find behind door wall

boy S grief


Ah age far away
the good heavenli land
though unbeheld quit near lay
and men could understand

the dead yet find
did love
they enter fill cheer
and pain expir bliss

Oh fairli shine bless land
Ah god weep pray
the heart thou holdest thi hand
love sunni day

see hundr thousand wait
around radiant throne
To dreari state
crowd be lone

care sing psalm
tire good men talk
To joy palm
Or whiterob solemn walk

love hear wild wind meet
the wild old wind night
To watch starlight throb beat
To wait thunderlight

love tale valiant men
Of women good fair
If rich strong ah
would someth rare

see thi templ sky
On pillar strong white
love though rise
and tri might

sometim joy lay hold
and speechless
almost martyr could
and join holi men

but soon heart like clod
My spirit wrapt doubt
A pillar hous god
and never go

No sunni breezi morn
No speechless moon
No ancient hill forlorn
vision boon

Ah god love never burn
nor shall tast thi joy
and jesu face calm stern
hapless boy




the childmoth


heavili lay warm sunlight
upon green blade shine bright
An outspread grassi sea
she burnish yellow flower
went walk golden hour
that slept upon lea

the bee went past hum
the merri gnat go come
In complic danc
like blue angel fro
the splendid dragonfli go
shot like seek glanc

she never follow still
went forward quiet
that got miss
with gentl step pass along
and low halfmurmur song
utter share bliss

It littl maidenchild
you see frolicsom wild
As child
for though nine
anoth littl child bore
almost big

with tender care strain arm
she kept circl harm
with face turn sun
for perfect tini heart
the mother sister nurs part
her womanhood begun

At length reach ugli ditch
the slipperi slope bank
flower long grass line
some raggedrobin babi spi
and spread littl arm wide
As found mine

what babi want babi
law unalter
the poor shall serv rich
she kneeleth eager eye
and reach far prize
toppl ditch

and slant bank roll
but littl bosom fold
she clasp babi tight
and ditch muddi flow
No safeti sought let go
At length stand upright

ala littl feet wet
her new shoe forget
and yet cri
her scanti frock dingi blue
her petticoat wet
but babi quit dri

and babi laugh babi crow
and babi right know
that noth wrong
and troubl heart yet stout
she plan ever get
with medit long

the bank higher head
and slipperi said
and babi
for even monkey goe
need finger toes
she perplex may

but puzzl good
though stare bank stood
which sunk grew higher
until invad dismay
lest babi patienc give way
she free mire

and ditch glad
but patient promenad
splash splash went poor feet
and babi thought rare good fun
and want done
and ditch flower sweet

but oh world left
the mead late reft
An infant proserpin
lay like fabl land
paradis sunni love
In warmth light divin

while hot sun overhead
she low wateri way tread
mid slimi weed frog
while distant field
the sound laughter faintli peal
Or bark villag dog

and ground began shake
and poor littl heart quak
for fear ad woe
till look last perforc
she saw head huge hors
Go past upon nose

and sound tear grass
and puf breath aw
and horn fright size
cow look broken hedg
and gaze edg
with great big juno eye

and sun went
and hors cow horn gone
and still help came near
till last heard sound
Of human footstep ground
and cri i m

It man much joy
who look amaz girl boy
and reach hand strong
give child said
she would let babi go
she endur long

So smile alarm
He stretch lusti arm
and lift togeth
and thank helper
did hasten homeward pain
wet sunni weather

At home length lo scarc speck
wa child heel neck
though sore mire
nor gave sign grief unrest
till hid upon mother breast
she wept till tire

and intermix sob wail
she told mother tale
but wet cheek glow
mother
let babi fall
never let go

Ah starworld face
We men women like grace
To bear shield
our race would soon young
it heart free ach pain
As childmoth

knowst thou sound upon window pane
said youth quietli outstretch lay
where hour outstretch lain

that hath gather west day
Be still dearest let eye yet rest
awhil upon thi face calm blest

knowst thou sound silenc slowli wrought
said youth eyelid softli rose
reveal eye depth thought
that lay beneath still repos
know said maiden nought
but loud wintri wind ever blow
swing great arm dreari pine

hearst thou bay hound said
draw back latticebar let
through cloudrift light fell noiselessli
upon cottag floor gaunt thin
leap staghound bound glee

and maiden close spatter glass

the youth halfrais lean hand
and besid sat maid
hi eye slow minut move scan
her calm peacelight face said
monoton like solemnread command
for love earth earthi laid
down lifeless mother womb last
the strang sound great pinebranch pass

again shadow glass
over moonbeam cottag floor
shapeless dim almost unseen doth pass
mingl sound raindrop door
but sound upon window
look sorrow doubt youth face wore
and two hound halfros gaze
eye counten taper dim

now noth thing maiden note
but turn face halfreproach look
As doubt whether word quot

Or upward spirit depth float
those word like bubbl low dead brook
but eye seem question yea No
and maiden answer T

love heaven heavenli faint smile

He gentli laid head upon breast
hi thought bark sunni isl
At length hath found rest

the littl clock rung hour ten

moan great pinebranch bow
As tri vain wind stem
still look eye youth said thou

but earnest thi brow
thine eye beam like darkbright gem
that pour hidden heart upon night
the ray gather noonday light

look hand belov thou didst see

At midnight moon set wilt thou dare
To go must go alon
To meet agoni spare
she spoke rose toward mantl went
hi eye thank well content

not yet yet time see

yet time scarc left tell thee
the past present come power
Of great dark fall
rose jasmin twine bridal bower
If ever bower bridal joy mine
horror dark must bower entwin

under head maiden put arm
and knelt besid half lean breast
As soul bodi would shield harm
from whose love made blest
and well heal eye might charm
hi doubt thought trust rest
He drew hid face heart upon
then spoke low voic sound changeless

strang word fear spake
the maiden move repli
and ever spoke wind make
feebler moan away die
then rain ceas movement brake
the silenc save clock divid
the hour quick moment spark time
scorch soul watcheth chime

He spoke sin pride caus
Of suffer merci wander wild
Of faint noontid ocean dim
Of earthli beauti oft beguil
and sudden storm contest grim
from emerg newborn child
wander throughout teach earth
No rest attain new birth

but find heart like mine
with love live unlov hour
fold faith like violet lien
fold warm earth till sunni shower
calleth forth thought thought twine
weav around us fragrant bower
where within may sleep togeth drawn
fold love morn dawn

then shall rest weari day work oer
deep sleep bath steep soul

all time billow us shall pour
then ebb away far beneath us roll
We shall behold like stormi lake
neath clear height peac awak

her face lip lip press
wa sole answer maiden made
with arm held breast
T moment yet said
one word power strengthen lest
she give way amid trial dread
the clock gave warn hour
and thatch fell sound shower

one long kiss maiden rose fear
fell like shadow dim upon heart
trembl someth ghostli near
but bold part
then youth rose cheek pale eye clear
and help maid whose trembl hand thwart
her hast tie gather mantl fold
then forth went midnight cold

the moon sunken low dim west
curl upward steep horizon brink
leaf glori fall rest
the maiden hand still trembl scarc could link
her side arm round waist
stole gentli walk sink
her hand right side soon held fast
and togeth wound onward pass

and cling side felt full well
the strong measur beat heart
but float moon aye lower fell
slowli felt bound forc depart
till like throb bird tell
whether beat length start
she felt arm relax around flung
and circl arm lean hung

but step feebl grow
she feel strength courag rise amain
He lift head moon low
almost world edg smile pain
wa lip larg eye turn slow

pour love mani lovelit gleam
So walk like two soul link one dream


footnot

In love garden walk
two lover went hand hand
two wan sick figur talk
they sat floweri land

On cheek kiss
and kiss upon mouth
fast clasp one anoth
and back came health youth

two littl bell rang shrilli
and dream went hour
she lay cloister stilli
He far dungeontow

translat uhland

hang head behind came hound
with slow noiseless paw upon road
what shine weedi ground
nought bright eye dingi toad
the silent pine rang everi way around
deep stream left side hardli flow
their path toward moon die alon
It touch horizon dip gone

it last gleam fell upon dim glaze eye
An old man totter feebli hold
stoop bend knee could rise
nor longer could arm waist infold
the maiden trembl disguis
her love beheld never could grow old
and age man young warm
clasp closer yet support arm

till short drag step turn asid
into closer thicket tall fir
whose bare straight slender stem behind hide
smooth grey rock not pineneedl stir
till go then low wind blow wide
oer conetop It swell whirr
through long stem aeolian chord
for mould mystic sound lack word

but enter narrow cleft
into rock heart suddenli ceas
and tall pine stood still bereft
Of strong passion pain releas
onc wove strang dark moveless weft
oer dull midnight sky east
mist aros clomb skyey stair
and like sad thought bat came unawar

T dark chamber bridal night
O poor pale saviour bride faint rushlamp
He kindl shake hand light
paint tini halo damp
that fill cavern unseen height
like deathcandl midnight swamp
within side entranc lie hound
with liquid light green eye gleam round

couch rais rocki floor
Of wither oak beechleav wind
had toss till weari cover oer
with skin bear featheri moss line
and last lamb wool long soft hoar
receiv old man bend limb reclin
gentli maiden uncloth
and lay besid trust loath

again storm among tree oerhead
the hound prick ear eye flash fire
seem trembl maiden tread
light yet clear amid wind loud ire
As drip feet oer smooth slab hither sped
came often fierc desir
To enter oft made quick retreat
and look forth hound stood feet

then came half querul whisper old
feebl hollow chest
take face bosom cold
straightway bare bosom white soft nest
and head gentl hand lovebold
with grey wither face press
Ah maiden old chill
but thi warm heart beneath grew still

again wind fall raincloud pour
rush earth soon heard sound
Of fierc torrent thick night roar
the lamp went dark drown
No morn dawn oh never
like centuri feebl hour went round
dead night lay oer clasp lay
within holi place unburi clay

the hour stood still life sunk low
that wretched life knew
charnel wind sung moan no
earth centr grave blew
earth love beauti pass sigh slow
rose lili children friend
but transpar blanch everi part
she saw pale worm lie heart

and worst O death gladsom life
voic within awok cri In sooth
there need sorrow care strife
for women beauti call truth
Is glow heart fanci rife
pass away slowli fade youth
gaze narrowli waver blot
look fixedli

and answer poor child could make
lay tighten grasp two hand
she felt lay moulder awak
within sepulchr fast stoni band
and care though die sake
and dark horror grew like drift sand
till nought seem beauti god light

while stormcloud darkli brood found

If thou hadst sculptor race
Of form divin ever preach men
Lo behold thi brow gloriou

bring thought birth human grace

thou openest thu thi mysteri ken
strike marbl window blind space
but god mouldeth lifeplast clay
flash thought men live eye
not still marbl form changeless alway
breath forth human self human guis
thou didst appear walk unknown abroad
the son man human subject god




there buonarotti stand thi statu take
possess form inherit
Go forth upon earth like fit
As trumpetcri morn wake
the sleep nation light terror shake
the slumber heart sit
let leap aghast pit
agap beneath hear answer make
ala dare could inform
that imag rever trace
dim glori grace
nor feebl spirit mock enorm
strength brow thou camst god thought thi form
live larg signific thi face




some men beheld wonder
nobl form featur god design
In thought must search mine
for live soul went
thu walk earth and bent
frequent regard women gave sign
that god will beauti He drew line
that shape float fold beauti tent
but soul draw littl space
thu left form stare selfdismay
vacant sign might grace
If mind swell fill plan display
each curv shade thi pure form thine
thi hair replet divin




If thou hadst painter fresh look
what shine pent glori new grace
had burst upon us great earth face
how read newlanguag book
clear love god lone retreat nook
lili thi hand form would trace
were plainli seen god child lower race
and O heart blue hill grassi brook
thi soul lay undul bare
answer wave each morn sun rise
and god world woke beneath lifegiv sky
thou sawest clear thi father mean
mid earth ideal express rare
the ideal man etern eye




but look pictur made man
wherein first appear chao wild
So high art transcend beguil
the eye formless without plan
until spirit brood oer began
To see purpos rise like mountain pile
when god said let dri earth undefil
rise wave rose twilight wan
and fear thi pictur strang
for us pierc beyond outmost look
vapour dark seal book
An atmospher high wing rang
At god design spirit pale chang
trembl void thought brook




and earth thi live pictur
thou utterest beauti simpl profound
In form wondrou union bound
where one may see first step stair
and next brood vapour
and god well content starri round
should wake infant inarticul sound
Or lofti song burst heart prayer
and men low lofti mind
who heart hear thi unspoken word
have lesson low lofti kind
In thi live show beauti lord
while child heart simpli childlik
know father face look full




If thou hadst poet On heart

and beheld thee natur thou art
O poet poet poet thi feet

where spirit show form form refin

with sens divin grow till combin
We heard music planet wind
In harmoni billow strand
till one earth god utter
We hardli knew whether sun outspak
Or glad sunshin spirit brake

ala O poet leader good

So thou hadst scorn human eye

If truth artist thou hadst men

To travel wretch void lie
twixt soul truth hadst love fear

where strang mysteri shape doth lie

So one ideal beyond taint

In everi splendour shadowi reveal
but word hand thee one would paint

earli poem



long


away citi herd
away noisi street
away storm word
where hate hate meet

away vapour grey
that like bode ill
Is blot morn gay
and gather darken still

away stupid book
for like fog weari rest
with anger dull fill nook
Of ach misti breast

over shine shore
there hangeth space blue
part mid thin cloud hoar
where sunlight fall

the glad wave kiss shore
rejoic tell ever
the boat glide oar
Is flash river

Oh thee
thou love
the sparkl sand sea
and sunshin god




MY eye make pictur

My eye make pictur shut
coleridg


fair morn bring greet
To lofti sky pale
save cloudshr fleet
befor drive gale
the weari branch toss
careless autumn grief
shadow sunlight cross
On earthspot leaf

escap griev
and close eye
and see light boat heav
where billow fall rise
see sunlight glanc
upon silveri sail
where youth wild heart danc
and maiden grow pale

and quietli pace
the smooth stone oer oer
where merri wave chase
each shore
word come listen
where rock water meet
and littl shell glisten
In sandpool feet

away white sail gleam
again close eye
and autumn light stream
from pale blue cloudless sky
upon lone hill fall
mid sound heatherbel
where run stream call
unto silent well

along pathway lone
My hors move slow
No live thing save
the homereturn crow
and moon larg peer
Up white cloud foam
and gladli near
My father hous home

As gentli dream
the solemn tree look
the hill water seem
In still sleep round
and soul ring
tone spiritlyr
As belov sing
amid sisterchoir

If peac spirit
how oft d close eye
and earth inherit
and chang sky
thu leav sermon dreari
thu leav lone hearth
No spirit weari
free one earth




death


when like garment flung asid night
thi bodi lie sculptur cold rest
when shade window come light
and white hand fold breast

how Me tenant
how shall feel first wander
how look tear love eye fall how

over citi crowd wall
over tree meadow list
over mountain ceaseless fall

over red cliff fantast rock
over sea fardown fleet away

but spirit god doth make sound
and thought insect creepeth around
and sunshini butterfli come go
like beauti thought move fro

Is unknown spirit moveth thing
and longmantl moth sleep noon
and danc light mystic moon

but He care spider care fli
and He care littl child smile sigh
how know

the treeroot met spongi ground
look water lay
becaus met twine around
embrac went way

drop dash drop rainshow fell
yet strove join togeth
and rose earth bright clear well
sing sunni weather

sound met sound wavi air
they kiss sister true
yet jostl journey fair
each path flew

wind met wind garden green
each way pled
and trampl whirlwind danc
till flower love lay dead




To ccp

the bird leafi tree
the bird cloudi sky
the fish wavi sea
the stag mountain high
the albatross asleep
On wave rock deep
the bee light wing born
over bend corn
what thought breast
Of littl bird rest
what thought song
which lark sky prolong
what mean dolphin ray
wind wateri way
what thought stag
state yonder crag
what doth albatross think
dream upon brink
Of mountain billow
dream glen
what thought bee
fleet silent
flit part part
speedili gentli rove
like love thought heart
ever rest move
what life thought
doth prais soul employ
think nought
but trembl movement fro
Of bright lifegiv joy
and god cloudless day
who soul heart doth know
taketh joy prais
and biddeth fountain flow

and thi life earth
In chamber hearth
mid crowd citi tide
Or high lone hillsid

whenc water bless flow
find thi reward thing
which thou hast blest
let joy other caus joy spring
Up thi bosom
and love grate heart
As rich reward given
lift thou love grate heart
To god love heaven




hope defer


summer come the sun bright
and soft wind breath We joy
and see eye light
Of joy smile hope our employ
shall like bird airi castl thing
built gay hope fond imagin
peopl land within us We tell
Of green hill silent sea
and summer thing calmli dwell

and thought wander upon sorrow
yet hope wait upon faroff morrow

with slow yearlong overshadow decay
yea spring first blossom disappear

about heart keep us gay
the young claim joy haunt
our vision push us far away
into desol region dim grey
where sea hath moan cloud
No rain tear apathi doth shroud
all time but keep
togeth thu tide youth sweep
round us thousand joyou wave
As round palmi island deep
and youth hover round us like breath
Of one sleep sleepeth death

the sunder door one palac home
through age thicket falter go
If He lead us will
believ youth past

love radiant lamp burn cave dome
and like lamp age long glow
In bless grave weari load
Of tombbuilt year heav cast
for youth immort away

shine till everi wrinkl fold
with transfigur conquer might
that youth face wonder shall behold
and shall glad fear old




the death OF the old year


the weari old year dead last
hi corps mid ruin time cast
where moulder wreck lost thought lie
and richhu blossom passion die
To wither grass droop oer grave

On weedi column beneath eye
and strang sound ghostlik breez
In linger leav skeleton tree
and strang sound fall shower
when cloud dead pain oer spirit lower

where pride like god high

where thing evil pain entwin
and hate sorrow mine
O weari old year would might

On wither cheek life eb away

In cloudi robe lay shadow wide

and eye calm unimpass power

there fear evil whose stoni eye
froze joy gush melodi
some float afar thi tranquil wave
and heart look search grave
while other guest bosom came
and left wild children sorrow less shame
for deathlook part chill brow
and bless head bow
and float away faroff gloom

there hope found place rest
their foot mid rush allocean breast
and home sicken heart flew back
but chang sorrow upon track
and moan darken sea

there joy look forth maiden eye
and smile gone sad surpris
and love earthli whose beauteou form
beckon sunshin storm
but bound heart sprang high
meet smile speechless sigh
the arm sunk home pain start

and voic die seem hear
but whether breath mine ear
Or sound break billow roll
the linger accent upon soul

bless thi god word came nigh
To guid thee home thi nativ sky

and rise higher shine clearer

and everi hill valley would start

To him led home hi heart
and thing live world within
with glad tear hi feet come
and fals self banish fiend dwell
In gloomiest haunt nativ hell
and pride rule like god
Be trod neath feet triumphant love

and point across sea

and tear unbidden blind mine eye
and hide vision home love

whenev thi foot shall imprint strand
and loveliest thing mine

for death time to forgot
and go oblivion entereth

with sad smile frozen upon face

Oh let rais desert heart

In ear sleep music rung
and tone upheld harmoni deep
where spirit float yea soar sweep
with wild unearthli word tone

In calm delirium mystic sound
Up geniu thought alon

Of dew unknown cloud distil

In cavern solitud soul
but voic never broke
through sea sound us roll
choke ear daylight strife
there sorrow triumph death life
In chordnot prophetsong

such chant ere voic fled death
Be mine mould part breath

mari magdalen


with eye aglow aimless zeal
throughout land goe
her tone motion reveal
mind without repos

she climb hill haunt sea
By mad tortur driven
one hour forget would
gift heaven

the night bring sleep sleep distress
the tortur day
return free darker dress
In secur dismay

No softcaress sooth palm
her confid rais
No eye hath love forc calm
and draw answer gaze

He come He speak light divin
dawn graciou thi soul
thou seest love order shine
hi health make thee whole

one wrench pain one pang death
and faint delight
thou liest wait new breath
for morn night

thou risest earth fair
the wind cool free
As dream mad despair
dissolv ecstasi

and pledg life futur high
thou seest master stand
the life love eye
it power hand

what matter come time
will stain thi virgin name
attribut thi distress crime
the worst womanfam

yea call woman magdalen
whom slowreviv grace
turneth last evil men
To seek father face

what matter the night gone
right joyou shine sun
the clear sun alway shone
ere sorrow begun

Oh name may come bide
If well content
To see seldom side
thi head seren bent

thou share aw doom
wilt help thi lord die
and mourn oer empti tomb
first share victori

the woman IN the templ


still dark joy sudden face
cold daylight footstep cri
the templ nake shine space

with thi wild abandon hair
and terrorpallid lip
thi blame uncloud air

from eye withdrawn
the aw silenc spread around
In avert dawn

with guilti eye bent downward still
with guilti listless hand
all idl hopeless

the righteou judg lift might
the solemn voic repli

what woman He speak thee
for thee silenc stir
let sin free
cast first stone

upon deathstain ashi face
the kindl blush glow
No greater wonder sure place
when lazaru forth go

dead conscienc rise slow
they dumb aw guest
turn one one go

they alon the silenc dread
close deepen round
her heart full pride dead
No place fear found

hath He spoken side
those cruel men withstood
even shame would hide
Ah will good

He rise they gone but lo
she standeth
neither condemn thee go
and sin

she turn went the veil tear

her childhood dawn heaven appear
and kind make clean

and way veil tear

No face see voic hear

and return one voic one face

To keep chamber pure

Ah lord fault come

Ah father holi grace
