the birth OF the land

for thousand year devil crouch
On white hot flag hell
for thousand year devil curs
the imp chain well
for thousand year devil sulk
and plan helltrain brain
Of thing d term thru
and freed blister chain

He d even score men earth
and give back pain pain
for day felt blaze
and sear gall chain
and came pass time
and hell gate open wide
that hell rang clinker imp sang
when devil pass outsid

serv time devil said
As halt heaven gate
sweat hell thousand year
and year year hate
frame plan thousand year
work detail well
now d place near human race
As sort prep school hell

the son men earth
have scarc chanc sin
church bell gown mope around
By precept seal
there never sin lust flesh
nor sin man struck blow
and red blood crime olden time
ha pass long ago

hell motley crew scarc worth coal
when come thing call death
they squat coal real damn soul
and listen bate breath
To tale earth world new
when man fight
when took wife risk life
and kill halfbak bone

now d build place man might sin
for sake desir
make caus law
and penalti mine fire
hast place earth breed men
each deed blame
If ll give place ll breed race
that hell may shame

the god king sigh search plat
and map earth
given place everi race
In belt snow snow
given home bird beast
for even fox hole
given land son man
and ve build home soul

In seven day toil
when build sea land
there much nt get thru
and one place unfinish stand
It part work realli regret
for know worst lot
It known the land snow
Or the countri god forgot

It stand apart northern pole
unfinish forgotten alon
and man hand land
and man call
the countri made odd end
unfinish mountain swamp lake
stuff could nt use earth fuse
If want take

ll take plot devil quoth
for like descript well
ye ll take place ll mould race
that credit hell
then whistl imp uttermost part
and drop comet whirl
past white bake star past venu mar
To unfinish part world

He land last denali crest
and gaze acr wide
barren bleak mountain peak
and swamp arctic tide
the devil grin stood gaze
said thi need
It place plan downfal man
where ll chang ambit greed

then summon legion hell side
name arch imp straw boss crew
tho gibber curs one worst
with job satan gave
they tumbl mountain high end
pile glacier stream ought
and swamp land place desol wast
that stretch hill sea

they shook hell climat fit
but could nt get suit hell
So took worst part devilish art
they built one suit well
they laid muck swamp water lie dead
bred mosquito moos fli gnat
put brown bear kill barren brown hill
and quill pig infest flat

they shut sun full half year
made glacier blizzard blown trap
they strung volcano half way japan
each one hair trigger cap
they plan coast line system storm
each equip nineti mile breath
and spread oer fog men call
the north coast mantl death

then know full well man would go
To land forlorn behold
He salt hillsid stream
with nugget trace gold
He tint hill green copper ledg
and cover valley game
all lure devil felt sure
that white man would fall



the land

the lure littl known place
still call call sire
the long wide open space
the perfum even camp fire
the hunt treasur unfound yet
the knock fortun gate
the deed joy breed
were use devil bait

the summer besprinkl sunshin
the hillsid riot bloom
with meadow color shot grandeur
and valley still tomb
with mountain cloudencas beauti
Or star shine
It trail nt know call us go
and wonder man heed call

the winter trail unbroken
the far field beckon call
the song frost runner
and northern light high
the tree bend river
the stream nobodi span
the whisper gold stori half told
all devil plan

when trap devil readi
widespread went whisper gold
and white men stamped like cattl
there never tie could hold
the first mad rush northland
when scum four end earth
came rush scrambl crush
like scrap fuse pot hurl

they came untaught readi
spur mad rush gold
they die unsung uncar
Of famin scurvi cold
they law wolf pack
stay die fail
and path northern placer
are mark grave trail

the town start plagu spot
with brothel danc hall aglar
with crib faro bank roulett wheel
and phonograph ad blare
all trap young unwari
all build help fall
never dealer fair never game squar
for devil presid oer

nick fiendishli grin saw work
and chuckl devilish glee
when come make uptod hell
they ve sure got hand
for everi ten soul come land
there nine head hell
with never fight percentag right
and prep school quit well



thu time rule land
where might ventur forth
for never manmad law held good
from dixon entranc north
He held land claw tip grip
and took pay soul
their blame play game
and paid hell coal

but devil lost law came
Or men made law
the gambl hall danc hall went
and devil forc paus
for life land develop men
men alien breed
new made lot could nt bought
and stranger graft greed

they loos land devil grip
they pierc hill trail
they flag rock harbor mouth
they pave way rail
they build school danc hall stood
and brought children wive
they gave new land call
and gave live

now pimp brothel pass away
and gambl hall dream
railroad train follow trail
where follow ninedog team
thousand stamp sing song
where pan gold shot ledg
and pictur show mark line
that frontier edg

the milch cow graze brown bear roam
and saw mill sing lay
On bar yukon river
where pan one summer day
they rais wheat bull moos graze
In summer long ago
It seem kind strang note chang
but d rather



yet sometim dream camp night
In bend river flow
Of land land knew
In day long ago
the wild free land bred men
who fought might main
and took land devil hand
and d like see





woman dog and walnut tree

when the water start TO run

along earli spring time sun start swing north
To linger land love violet peep forth
when water start run thru riffl block noon

and pard ca nt interest matter tri
you re lonesom moodi restless camp town

then memori pull picket pin thought go back thru year
To outsid home sweetheart last thought sort cheer

and regret rememb end goodbi
It old worldwid feel come man year
but seem hit us harder re get clear
It seem grow stronger year ad life

Go forward like father go forth seek mate

lest ye two rate one count twain
and come outsid camp rememb new

and tempter voic silenc music voic
then re true alaskan home north
god grant children voic violet peep forth
and summer even beneath midnight sun

the throwback

He born far east rocki
Of pet societi van
winesoak daughter pleasur
bred back threw man
manchild grew stranger
who never could learn way
Of peopl gaug pleasur
On line price pay

just shred educ
year colleg life
cours card wine room
year chorusgirl wife
then disgust life unnatur
spur curs go
He quit life forev
for land gold snow

the lure land grip
the land die fail
the land fabl fortun
the land endless trail
the land lone silenc
the land cruel cold
the land lost ambit
alaska land gold

there winter long hungri hardship
summer pestridden heat
dice death grub stake
risk life meat
toss away young manhood
give best youth
To hole bedrock wildcat
where gold scarcer truth

ten year spent alaska
gray hair cheek atan
beaten still unconqu
flat broke still man
dig sink drift
tri locat pay
with hole fresh disappoint
yet hope strike next day

scorn letter recal
forget friend known
turn back outsid
face futur alon
cabin squaw fishwheel
bend river flow
band halfnak breed kid
He stay sourdough





the malamut

when star sky fallen
and smoke world clear away
when saint peter mark life book
and meet judgment day
when trial troubl end
and re wise best worst
when time arriv wise one
have told us last shall first

when men ve made good reward
and loser turn loos hell
that time lot learn
the true reason caus fell
and wonder peter get busi
As work tenement plan
and heaven thrown free locat
will confin locat man

If claim open jump
for ca nt figur heaven complet
If dim distant trail sky land
are patter malamut feet
caus know would never seem homelik
No matter golden strand
If lose pallov feel
Of malamut nose hand

and way lot alaskan
these men last frontier
who tear natur unaid
and scarc know mean fear
who live lone creek alon
where live die hard
and oft time companion
Is malamut pup pard

He real chum thing come easi
He pal thing break tough
He hellroar fight companion
when somebodi start someth rough
He true friend sorrow sick
and nt mind hunger cold
and realli one pardner
you trust uncov gold

He guard trust sluic box
and ll watch cach thru night
and cheechako tri molest
that cheechako fight
As pardner silent cheer
with never kick bout trail
and nt winter
there never would mail

He pull sled winter
He first rush stamped
He goe hors could nt travel
and besid rustl feed
He take pack saddl summer
and follow us thru hill
and go short grub pile
He share whatev kill

T malamut first scale chilkoot
At time great klondik charg
T malamut first saw lake bennett
and left footprint La barg
they haul first mail dawson
that land old timer dream
and wada first drove fairbank
He drive malamut team

they broke first trail bettl
with guid save lone northern star
they freight next year kantishna
and fame chandelar
they know long trail innoko
tacotna iditarod
for never camp northland
but malamut knew

they brought first sport nome beach
where show action deed
that north dog game make
and besid plenti speed
He came home bacon candl
like bat hell thru snow
and plunger cash tab
wa pardner old sourdough

So seem kind unfair
As drift toward perman camp
where angel run danc hall
and millionair grade tramp
where trail locat pay dirt
and grub stake never expir
well shut dog keep
and ll siwash hell fire

they herald growth northland
and progress mark trail
railroad goe brought
the sewardiditarod mail
He first growth alaska
and without land would lost
for never stream countri
that malamut trail cross

but ca nt tell god would heaven
So man could nt mix friend
that re doom meet disappoint
when come place trail end
that would lowgrad sort heaven
and d never regret damn sin
If mush gate white pearli
and nt let malamut





unsatisfi

some sigh breath desert
where stifl heat wave blow
some pant trackless tundra
and sting cold snow
some long wash sultri sea
As break tropic shore
some pine breez northern sea
and sound arctic roar

the thing men love countless
but re seldom two
for thing care
might never appeal
some men run wine woman
some long wife home
and drift tide unsatisfi
who leav thing roam

for hate sand desert
and slimi tropic south
Or dream northern fortun

He lose best life hold man
hi exist mean discont

the prospector

where rag snowcap saw tooth
cut azur sky
and watch oer lone land
As age wander
where sentinel pine grandeur
murmur glacier stream
As icegorg glut canyon
never brighten gleam
Of sun brightest noon day
nor moon arctic night
and whose link heaven
Is fit northern light
where whistler shrill triumph
and big horn dream peac
where brown bear skulk cover
Up silenc hold leas
where land god left
nor known tread man
there treasur ledg await
Go find

If heart steel triumph
nor beat less defeat
can watch whole world melt away
and still smile fortun greet
will heart brain sinew
crowd hunger pain
gnaw belli re beaten
can lose fight
can rais cup fortun
To lip brave quaff
the draught prepar
and win lose laugh
can see fruit hardship
center one desper throw
and know fate dice load
nor curs see go
then take burden
and stagger trail
you re bound make win
caus nt know fail

ve spent youth follow
the lure hidden gold
must pass buck natur
and admit m grow old
and yet spring hear call
and music ear
the call lone place
that ve listen year
It cost men hold dear
some forti year life
and joy other get
In babi home wife
My life tomorrow
and famili dream
and averag plodder
ve miss seem
still ve never taken order
and ve alway like game
and life could live
whi d live

As long huski curs moon

As long quicksand mask bar
and placer ground unclaim
As long pay found stake

and ll ditch variou reason
and gal never know straight twice
and mind seem chang season

and thought squar till found
they tri cross miser pup

and d stick hard luck night day
they could ask rustl grub

Of kind men nt make good

that wash tropic tide
and mixtur dago japanes

but northland get sterner breed
To fuse harder mould
It breed men nt know fail
that breed men hit trail
for fabl land gold

and play game win
they fall women wine game

To fight never

As chase rainbow blend

It want win end

and whether strive lofti rang
Or tri crowd mart

He tri build none built

To find gold never hold
To finish done

He live life tri way
and scorn thing tame
If seem lost still fight
for ever play game
and effort make strive win
are credit breed
and god count give full amount
and accept act deed

the dream white man ever goe
To fight never
and ever plan thing
that say never done

It seldom valu thing
what crave never may gain
but ever tri till day die

the woman that you pass BY

My trade old world new
ere pyramid rose nile
men quit wive gave good
for warmth kiss smile
for never wife could hold man
By honeymoon afterglow
did veil mine eye beckon
god truth t know

My trade old world new
long ere caesar rule rome
To spend gold harlot cell
patrician quit home
and high born dame sinc world began
have learn sit sigh
and patient wait lord leav
the woman pass

m pawn game call life
yet take never could hold
garner kiss d barter life
and gather gold
garner best manhood prime
then quit shatter health
bring heel one love
and smile shear wealth

To garner wealth hold store
must keep surpass fair
for life lead open book
and game deal squar
stop think maid wive know
As drift thru life subtl game
how mani deal straight
how mani say

you give slave life
In struggl hold one man
you think re paid call wife
and true span
you keep hous bear child
and walk head held high
but love kiss go
To woman pass

the favor give sell gold
and men prize cost high
you never learn love goe
with tear woman eye
that patient drudg sit home
and learn save mend
can never hold light love
but doom lose end

So follow old dishonor trade
bedeck garment fine
and cream earth save
In raiment food wine
and life merri game
tho sometim weep sigh
for deep heart envi
the woman pass





whi

whi alaskan come back
when ve quit land good
whi man stay away
when sworn friend would
where lie grip countri hath
all tangl around heart
that take grip never slip
and never torn apart

Is lure summer sunshin
that goe head like wine
Is lure far flung meadow
Of shadowi scent pine
Is lure go none gone
Of alon wild
Is lure ancient glacier
that old christ child

they come wild athirst gold
they would win run away
they lose stake brought along
and stay
here one follow bent
the mine hill mart
work name end
the countri steal heart

there lure land poppi
there lure land birth
you swear abhor yet ll long
As land earth
there lure snow mantl vast
there lure valley hill
Of friend ve met ll never forget
and ll want come back





and still like alaska

ve tramp across endless mile tundra
ve raft rapid flow stream
she kept hummer
ve fought mosquit summer
and siwash neath aurora wintri beam
and still like alaska

went winter pay streak bacon
ve gone year noth much bean
ve squander time check
the kind give us roughneck
and nt got dollar jean
and still like alaska

got stake one time wander outsid
and m tell sure put dog
but got poke
they sure clean
and hit dixon entranc hog
and still like alaska

nt suppos man live beat
some day ll quit land ice snow
and devil git us
and find place fit us
and re work sulphur bed
know ll like alaska
