the lone dancer

heart join danc
danc long ago
Ah lightwing music franc

weav new pattern romanc
for bosom newfallen snow

but leav thu may hear

the silken whisper fairyfals
Of unseen rainbow circl near
and glad shudder wall

anoth danc dancer spin
shadowd mystic pain
and partner enter
and danc within lone brain
the sway woodland shod green
the ghostli dancer rain

the lone dancer sea
foamfoot sandi bar
the wizard danc wind tree
the eddi danc stream star
yea dancer tread
measur mourn bizarr

An echod ear eye
and sound evok shape thing
where silenc sigh
the sad world like pictur spring
As secret bird sweep
We see sound wing

those human feet upon floor
that eager puls rhythmic breath
how sadli unknown shore
each silver footfal hurryeth
danc autumn leav
On fantast wind death

fire clasp element fire
T thu solar atom whirl
the butterfli aeri gyre
On autumn morn swarm swirl
In danc delic desir
No boy girl

the strang music everywher
the woven pace
danc viewless air
into void whenc came
Ah make gallant flare

and mean lie
just music
who danc thu transfigur eye
hold vain close
onli music never die
the danc goe dancer goe

woman danc world
pois one crystal foot afar
In shine gulf silenc whirl
like note strang music
small shape anoth curl
Or danc dust make star

To play violin
all one join reel
drop danc enter
So neverend wheel
ceas mystic cours spin
for weal woe woe weal




flo aevorum

you must mean hour
you perfect thing subtli fair
simpl complex flower
wrought planetari care
how patient etern power
that wove marvel hair

how long sunlight sea
wove rewov rippl gold
To rhythm etern

wait miracl
and paint marvel manifold

still work unsatisfi
eager new effect tri
the solemn artist cast asid
rainbow shell butterfli
As stern blacksmith scatter wide
the spark anvil fli

how mani shell whorl within whorl
litter marg sphere
with wrack unregard pearl
To shape littl thing ear
creation make one girl
hath travail exceed fear

the moonlight forgotten sea
dwell eye tongu
the honey million bee
and sorrow song
you end
the world grew old make young

all time hath travel rose
To strang make face
came agoni fire snow
and death april night day
unnumb unimagin throe
find flower meet place

strang artist ach thought
give answer patient power
that perfect end wrought
shall mean noth hour

all word world
can tell love
all littl star shine
To make silver crown


all the word IN all the world

all flower weav
garland worthi hair
not bird four wind

onli sphere sing

said care not

said care
but look eye
but lay hand within hand

and fire cataclysm storm

Ah bosom made april flower

On april


all the wide world IS but the thought OF you

all wide world thought
who made wonder dew
wa god tear deep eye
who love woman white overwis
that strang put violet hair
and put face distanc


lightn may flicker round MY head

lightn may flicker round head
and world seem doom
If like wild rose walk

If sad heart may hear
your voic faeri laughter
what matter though heaven fall
and hell come thunder


the afternoon IS lone for your face

the afternoon lone face
the pamper morn mock day declin
rich noon sun mine

gird us round blue betroth ring
becaus heart mine heart preciou thing

the night desert till dawn
unless take ferryboat dream
and glide glori silver beam
under eyelid like sad curtain drawn
So good hap heart find way
where sweet lie fragrant disarray

Ah morn world begin anew
again sea shall sing feet
and earth heaven call sweet

Ah seem succeed year
thu hath woman blossom divin
flower path made frail delay
In true journey home thee

TO bird AT dawn

O bird somewher yonder sing
In dim hour twixt dream dawn
lone hush sleep thing
In sky sanctuari withdrawn
your perfect song like pain
and let sleep

think must bird
littl creatur soft wing
not deep thrill word
some morn planet t sing
sure small feather throat
well august etern note

As old languag dead
In one resound syllabl
say rome greec said
simpl word child may spell
So liquid note impearl
sing long epic world

unfathom sweet song
with ancient anguish core
what womb element wrong
with shudder unimagin bore
peac divin hell hath trod
thi voic softli talk god

all silenc one silver flower
Of speech speak save speak
the moon heaven yet hath power
To tell soul thing seek
and pack wizard art
the whole within finit part

To sweet bird one well might feign
with author sing
So clear yet profound strain
into simpl ear spring
some secret understand given
Of hid purpos heaven

and life day
and life die
all joy sorrow way
seem call yonder sky
and someth song saith
that make unafraid death

now slow light fill tree
the world still strang
with day familiar presenc
back common self must chang
and littl gossip shape song
the porch morn throng

not vie
that day small busi sing
voic man heart god sky
but O make deep thing
Of joy dare think pain
until hear sing


alma venu

onli breath hardli breath the shore
Is still huddl alabast floor
Of shelv ice shatter slab cold
stern wreckag fierc frozen wave
gleam mail wast white gold
As though sea enchant grave
Of fear crystal lock shall stir
softli lover april moon
hardli breath yet awar
Of delic balm upon air
almost voic almost whisper soon

not earth live thing
move iron landscap far near
save raucou flight winter crow
stain white ebon wing
Or silversail gull mid drear
rock cedar like summer soul astray
lone red squirrel make believ play
nibbl frozen snow

not earth hath scent song
nor hope aught memori dream
nor speech upon sullen tongu
nor liberti run stream
not earth hath forgot smile
but strang waft oer frozen sea
As hidden cytherean isl
veil within veil sweet came

beyond heav glitter floe
the free blue water sparkl sky
lose bright fro
long band mist trail lumin
and behind screen sea rim

and shadowi coast sudden glori swim
O land made distanc desir

travel halcyon breath presag spring
over water even secretli
she maketh readi hand bring
blossom blade wing
and soon wave shall rippl feet
and wild hair blown sky

and bosom world grow sweet
and blue seablu deep eye
the meadow like anoth sea shall flower
and earth song sing shower
while watch hollow grass
By sea edg may behold stand
with rosi feet upon yellow sand
paus dream woodland pass


AH did you ever hear the spring

Ah ever hear spring
call snow
Or hear littl blackbird sing
insid egg go
To green land grass begin
each tini seed grow

O heard none heard
Or seen none seen
O strang land
where one els

So gay danc feet
So like garden soft breath
So sweet smile upon face

the young moon tranc hold
captiv cloud orchard bloom
she snap finger grave
and laugh face doom

yet glad lurk fear
In mirth breath sigh
So soon pretti flower gone
and ah young die

Of oak beech hath build beam
and spin day secret loom

and whose halfsleep eye blue flower
On whose still breast waterlili heav

As along path brood peac
where thing dream noth els done
but gentl busi
Of leav rippl wind set sun

turn stream long lane gold
where young moon shall walk feet pearl
and frame sleep lili fold fold

To make us put clay

AN easter hymn

spake lord christ aris
It seem say void vain
how shall dead man rise
vain tear vain cri
not one littl band
that love him might understand

aris lord jesu said
hearken amid morn dew
mari voic calleth
then mari turn golden head
and lo shine side
her master crucifi

At dawn dim sepulchr
mari rememb far day
when feet spikenard lay
came bring balm spice myrrh
To grave made repli
He He die

praetor priest vain conspir
jerusalem rome vain
tortur god mortal pain
To quench seed live fire
but light heaven birth
can never put oh earth

aris across year
even mari grey morn
To us gentl voic born

O hearken well mystic word
let master speak unheard

No soul descend deep hell
the child sorrow sin death
the immort spirit suffereth
To see corrupt though fell
from loftiest station sky
It still heaven must rise

No dream faith seed love
No lone action nobli done
but stabl sun
and fed water
from nether base starri cope
natur two law faith hope

safe care heavenli power
the good dream might
lost beauti magic new
shall spring sure flower
when mid sob rain
the heart april beat

celesti spirit doth roll
the heart sepulchr stone away
Be resurrect day
the sing easter soul
O gentl master wise

ballad OF the seven oclock whistl

and hear dread scream
high dawn fill song

the fist dagger sword
and outspoken song

Ah bring love
that bargain bid buy
for much love give
So much lip eye

but love bosom bare
sweet bird wild
that savag maidenhood
cri littl child

Or hear remors voic sea
Or song wander wind tree
Or even watch butterfli
