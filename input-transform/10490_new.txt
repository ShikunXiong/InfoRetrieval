To visit bed pain death
Of restless limb quiver breath
and sorrow heart patient eye
that see tear sun go

My right food shelter
that may yon kirk go
To read upon yon sweet book

To call hole hous lord

O cordial delici O soother pain
It flash like sunshin brain
benison rest bishop send
such fudder wine friend

and flagon may ask
draught nobl bacharach cask
and gone though know full well
the cellar cheerful place cell
behold stand sound good
brown old oaken hood
silent seem extern
As carthusian monk may
but within spirit deep unrest
what seeth simmer breast
As heav great heart
would burst belt oak apart
let unloos button wood
and quiet littl turbul mood

set running

see current gleam shine
As caught purpl hue
Of autumn sunset rhine
descend mingl dew
Or grape stain blood
Of innoc boy year back
wa taken crucifi jew
In ancient town bacharach
perdit upon infidel jew
In ancient town bacharach
the beauti town give us wine
with fragrant odor muscadin
deem wrong let pass
without first touch lip glass
for midst current stand
like stone pfalz midst river
take toll upon either hand
and much grate giver

here inferior kind
such town may find
such one might imagin would suit
the rascal drank wine boot
and crime
for therebi dorf hueffelsheim
jolli old toper pull
could drink postilion jack boot full
and ask laugh done
If fellow left one
thi wine good afford
To friar sit lower board
and distinguish bad good
and far better could
be rather rude discipl beer
than anyth refin dear

We knew fear know
then suddenli horn began blow
and heard shout heavi tramp
and hors snort damp
nightair meadow green wide
and moment side side
So close must seem one
the shadow across moonlight run
and anoth came swept behind
like shadow cloud wind

how rememb breathless flight
across moor summer night
how feet long white road
backward like river flow

whilst farther away overhead

with bar window narrow tall
and pray wont pray

and thank god fever pain
that shadow midnight plain
were gone could come
struggl longer doom
thi happen mani year ago
left father home come
like catherin martyrdom
for blindli esteem
and heard convent door

felt smite like blow
through limb shudder ran
and bruis spirit fell

As nightair wound man

By slow degre wholli ceas

To earth turn heaven

ala world full peril

On sunniest side valley lead

We sever right wrong

To strongest heart yield

sudden dark fill room
and thi deep eye amid gloom

On leav sound fall rain

Of ride mani dusti leagu

In vagu immens
fade darken distanc
silent majest slow
the white ship haunt fro
with ghostli sail unfurl
As phantom anoth world
haunt dim confin exist
but ah comprehend
their signal good end
from land land come go
upon sea vast dark
the spirit dead embark
all voyag unknown coast
We wave farewel shore
and depart come
Or come phantom ghost

abov darksom sea death
loom great life
land cloud mysteri
dim mirag shape men
long dead pass beyond ken
awestruck gaze hold breath
till fair pageant vanisheth
leav us perplex
and doubt whether
vision world unseen
Or bright imag
against sky vapor thrown

lucif sing sea  thou didst make thou
canst mend
but thou hast power end
the sea silent sea discreet
deep lie thi feet
there confessor like unto death
thou canst see near
thou needest whisper thi breath
and hear
He answer question
the vagu surmis suggest
that fill thi soul doubt fear

princ henry the fisherman lie afloat
with shadowi sail yonder boat
Is sing softli night
but comprehend aright
the mean word sung
So sweetli nativ tongu
Ah ye sea still deep
all thing within bosom sleep
singl step oer
plung bubbl
and thou dear elsi wilt free
from martyrdom agoni

elsi come chamber upon terrac
the night calm cloudless
and still still
and star come forth listen
To music sea
they gather gather gather
until crowd sky
and listen breathless silenc
To solemn litani
It begin rocki cavern
As voic chaunt alon
To pedal organ
In monoton underton
and anon shelv beach
and shallow sand beyond
In snowwhit robe upris
the ghostli choir respond
and sadli unceas
the mourn voic sing
and snowwhit choir still answer
christ eleison

princ henry angel god thi finer sens perceiv
celesti perpetu harmoni
thi purer soul trembl believ
hear archangel trumpet breez
and forest roll ocean heav
cecilia organ sound sea
and tongu prophet speak leav
but hear discord despair
and whisper demon air




AT sea




il padrone the wind upon quarter lie
and freshen gale
that fill snowwhit lateen sail
swiftli light felucca fli
around billow burst foam
they lift oer sunken rock
they beat side mani shock
and upon flow dome
they pois like weathercock
between us western sky
the hill corsica aris
eastward yonder long blue line
the summit apennin
and southward still far away
salerno sunni bay
you see lie

princ henry Ah would never mine eye
might see tower night day

elsie behind us dark aw
there come cloud sea
that bear form hunt deer
with hide brown hoof black
and antler laid upon back
and flee fast wild fear
As hound track

princ henry Lo gaze break fall
In shapeless mass like wall
Of burnt citi broad red
the fire descend sun
glare window oerhead
athwart vapor dens dun
long shaft silveri light aris
like rafter support sky

elsie see summit lurid levin
flash downward without warn
As lucif son morn
fell battlement heaven

il padrone must entreat friend
the angri storm begin blow
for weather chang moon
all morn noon
We baffl wind sudden flaw
struck sea catspaw
onli littl hour ago
whistl saint antonio
for cap wind fill sail
and instead breez sent gale
last night saw st elmo star
with glimmer lantern play
On top mast tip spar
and knew foul weather today
cheerili hearti yo heav ho
brail mainsail let go
As wind saint antonio

Do see livornes felucca
that vessel windward yonder
run gunwal
look wind oertook
she sail set wonder
Is strength blast
did carri away mast
she galley gran duca
that fear algerin
convoy lazi brigantin
laden wine oil lucca
now readi high low
blow blow good saint antonio

Ha first dash rain
with sprinkl spray rail
just enough moisten sail
and make readi strain
see leap blast oertak
and speed away bone mouth
now keep head toward south
and danger bank breaker
with breez behind us go
not much good saint antonio
