cobbler keezar S vision


the beaver cut timber
with patient teeth day
the mink fishward cow
surveyor highway

when keezar sat hillsid
upon cobbler form
with pan coal either hand
To keep waxedend warm

and golden weather
He stitch hammer sung
In brook moisten leather
In pewter mug tongu

well knew tough old teuton
who brew stoutest ale
and paid goodwif reckon
In coin song tale

the song still sing
who dress hill vine
the tale haunt brocken
and whisper rhine

woodsi wild lonesom
the swift stream wound away
through birch scarlet mapl
flash foam spray

down sharphorn ledg
plung steep cascad
toss whiteman water
against hemlock shade

woodsi wild lonesom
east west north south
onli villag fisher
down river mouth

onli clear
with farmhous rude new
and treestump swart indian
where scanti harvest grew

No shout homebound reaper
No vintagesong heard
and green danc feet
the merri violin stir

whi folk glum said keezar
when natur glad
and paint wood laugh
At face sour sad

small heed careless cobbler
what sorrow heart
who travail pain birth god
and plant state prayer

hunt witch warlock
smite heathen hord
one hand mason trowel
and one soldier sword

but give ale cider
give pipe song
littl care church state
Or balanc right wrong

T work work work mutter
and rest snuffl psalm
He smote leathern apron
with brown waxen palm

Oh purpl harvest
Of day young
for merri grapestain maiden
and pleasant song sung

Oh breath vineyard
Of appl nut wine
for oar row breez blow
down grand old river rhine

tear blue eye glisten
and drop beard gray
old old said keezar
and rhine flow far away

but cun man cobbler
He could call bird tree
charm black snake ledg
and bring back swarm bee

all virtu herb metal
all lore wood knew
and art old world mingl
with marvel new

well knew trick magic
and lapston knee
had gift mormon goggl
Or stone doctor dee

for mighti master agrippa
wrought spell rhyme
from fragment mystic moonston
In tower nettesheim

To cobbler minnesing
the marvel stone gave
and gave turn keezar
who brought sea

He held mystic lapston
He held like len
and count long year come
By twenti ten

one hundr year quoth keezar
and fifti told
now open new
and shut old

like cloud mist black
roll magic stone
and marvel pictur mingl
the unknown known

still ran stream river
and river ocean join
and bluff blue sealin
and cold north hill behind

but mighti forest broken
By mani steepl town
By mani whitewal farmhous
and mani garner brown

turn score millwheel
the stream ran free
white sail wind river
white sail faroff sea

below noisi villag
the flag float gay
and shone thousand face
the light holiday

swiftli rival ploughmen
turn brown earth share
here farmer treasur
there craftsman ware

golden goodwif butter
rubi currantwin
grand strut turkey
fat beev swine

yellow red appl
and ripe pear russetbrown
and peach stolen blush
from girl shook

and bloom hill wildwood
that shame toil art
mingl gorgeou blossom
Of garden tropic heart

what see said keezar
Am
Is fete bingen
Do look frankfort fair

but clown puppet
and imp horn tail
and rhenish flagon
and foam ale

strang thing know happen
strang thing lord permit
but droughti folk jolli
puzzl poor old wit

here smile manli face
and maiden step gay
nor sad think mad drink
nor mope fool

hero pleasur without regret
and good without abus
the holiday bridal
Of beauti use

here priest quaker
Do cat dog agre
have burn stock ovenwood
have cut gallowstre

would old folk know children
would graceless town
with never ranter worri
and never witch drown

loud laugh cobbler keezar
laugh like schoolboy gay
toss arm
the lapston roll away

It roll rug hillsid
It spun like wheel bewitch
It plung lean willow
and river pitch

there deep dark water
the magic stone lie still
under lean willow
In shadow hill

but oft idl fisher
sit shadowi bank
and dream make marvel pictur
where wizard moonston sank

and still summer twilight
when river seem run
out inner glori
warm melt sun

the weari millgirl linger
besid charm stream
and sky golden water
shape color dream

fair wave sunset garden
the rosi signal fli
her homestead beckon cloud
