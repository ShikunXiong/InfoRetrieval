IT can BE done




BE the best OF whatev you are


We dream great deed high posit away petti
humdrum ordinari life yet success occupi lofti place
conspicu work best rattl
around big job much wors fill small one
overflow dream aspir mean ruin life
must lead dream pipedream one would like lead
make perhap trivial immedi
task one sure way prove mettl Do thing near
hand great thing come hand done


If ca nt pine top hill
Be scrub valley
the best littl scrub side rill
Be bush ca nt tree

If ca nt bush bit grass
and highway happier make
If ca nt muski bass
but liveliest bass lake

We ca nt captain ve got crew
there someth us
there big work lesser
and task must near

If ca nt highway trail
If ca nt sun star
It nt size win fail
Be best whatev

the hous BY the side OF the road


thi poem keynot friendship sympathi peopl
It paradox life hoard love happi lose
give away keep
the share possess We cours find
peopl weak sin best mean cure
wise sympathet understand


let live hous side road
where race men go
the men good men bad
As good bad
would sit scorner seat
Or hurl cynic ban
let live hous side road
and friend man

see hous side road
By side highway life
the men press ardor hope
the men faint strife
but turn away smile tear
both part infinit plan
let live hous side road
and friend man

know brookgladden meadow ahead
and mountain wearisom height
and road pass long afternoon
and stretch away night
but still rejoic travel rejoic
and weep stranger moan
nor live hous side road
like man dwell alon

let live hous side road
where race men go
they good bad weak strong
wise foolish
then sit scorner seat
Or hurl cynic ban
let live hous side road
and friend man

To think without confus clearli
To love fellowmen sincer
To act honest motiv pure
To trust god heaven secur

from collect poem




IF


the central idea poem success come selfcontrol
true sens valu thing In extrem lie danger man
must lose heart doubt opposit yet must
best see ground He must deceiv think
either triumph disast final must use wise push
In thing must hold golden mean If
world even better person reward attain
full statur manhood


If keep head
are lose blame
If trust men doubt
but make allow doubt
If wait tire wait
Or lie nt deal lie
Or hate nt give way hate
and yet nt look good talk wise

If dream make dream master
If think make thought aim
If meet triumph disast
and treat two impost
If bear hear truth ve spoken
twist knave make trap fool
Or watch thing gave life broken
and stoop build em wornout tool

If make one heap win
and risk one turn pitchandtoss
and lose start begin
and never breath word loss
If forc heart nerv sinew
To serv turn long gone
and hold noth
except will say hold

If talk crowd keep virtu
Or walk king lose common touch
If neither foe love friend hurt
If men count none much
If fill unforgiv minut
with sixti second worth distanc run
your earth everyth

We often think peopl shallow think incap anyth seriou
profound work humdrum speech trivial
such judgment unfair sinc part life show
other superfici likewis though consciou

think god

Of quarrelsom neighbor

rooster one morn preen feather
that glisten bright sun
He admir tint variou color
As laid place one one
now rooster go fine bird
and satisfi
but suddenli march along
some peacock feather spi
they beauti spot color gay
He wish could green
He drop tail tri hide away
wa complet asham seen

then foolish mind hatch scheme
peacock yet could
So hop behind bush undress
where fowl could see
He caught tail bill
and pull everi feather
and hole stuck peacock plume
then proudli strut
the fowl rush see queer sight
and peacock came heard
they could agre
but pronounc funni bird

then chicken angri one kind
should tri peacock
and peacock mad one tail
should belong common fowl flock
So chicken beset cruelli behind
and yank whole tail togeth
the peacock attack madli
and pull chicken feather
and stood strip clean skin
horribl thing rest
He learn sad lesson late
As simpl self best

HE whom dream hath possess


the man possess vision perplex troubl restrict
rest us He wander yet lost home see million
dawn yet never night descend face death destruct
find triumph


He dream hath possess knoweth doubt
for mist blow wind mouth word scorn
not sinuou speech school hear knightli shout
and never come dark yet greeteth million morn

He dream hath possess knoweth roam
all road flow wave speediest flight know
but wherev feet set soul forev home
and go come come heareth call goe

He dream hath possess knoweth sorrow
At death drop leav fade sun smile
for dream rememb past scorn desir morrow
and dream sea doom set sure ultim isl

He dream hath possess tread impalp march
from dust day long road leap laugh star
and ruin world fall view etern arch
