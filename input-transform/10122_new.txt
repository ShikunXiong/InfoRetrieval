TO AN ungentl critic

the great sun sink behind town
through red mist volnay wine
but use set
that gloriou blaze behind town
you ll skip page ll look
for newer pictur book
you ve read sunset rich mine

A fresh wind fill even air
with horrid cri night bird
but read new curiou
when cold wind fli across air
you ll frown ll turn page
but find glimps new age
Of poetri wornout word

must wind cut like blade steel
and sunset swim volnay
the holiest cruellest pain feel
die stillborn old men squeal
for someth new write someth new
We ve read poem one
and twelv like em yesterday

No chicken shall scrawl
just fanci strike
fairi fusili
old broken knockkne thought crawl
across vers classic way
and sir care say
there oldfashion folk still like




AN old twentythird man

Is threeandtwentieth strabo mine
march still gulp wine
from sad magic fragrant cup
the redfac old centurion start
curs batter tabl No said
not the threeandtwentieth legion
dead
dead first year damn campaign
the legion dead dead wo nt rise
piti rome piti brave lad die
but need piti also
whom gallic spear belgian arrow miss
who live see legion come
unsoldierlik slovenli bent loot
grumbler diseas unskil thrust shoot
O brown cheek muscl shoulder sturdi
thigh
where god watch struggl

the sullen pack rag ugli swine
Is legion gracchu quick
wine
strabo said gracchu strang tonight
the legion legion right
If new men slovenli think
god damn ll better drink
they tri strabo trust heart hand
the legion legion rome stand
and men autumn fall
shall bang old vercingetorix gaul




TO lucasta ON go TO the war
for the fourth time

It nt matter caus
what wrong say re right
curs treati bond law
when re fight
and sinc lad proud true
what els remain
lucasta franc man
return fourth time hate war
yet laugh calmli
and fling oath say
that courag fear
lucasta fusili
and pride send

let statesmen bluster bark bray
and decid start
thi bloodi war pay
but must stoutheart
must sit stake quiet breath
play card death
Do nt plume fight
It courag love hate
but let us thing
It pride make heart great
It anger fear
lucasta fusili
and pride keep




two fusili

and done war last
well ve lucki devil
and need pledg oath
To bind love friendship fast
By firmer stuff
close bound enough

By wire wood stake re bound
By fricourt festubert
By whip rain sun glare
By miseri loud sound
By spring day
By picard clay

show two close bound
As red bond blood
By friendship blossom mud
By death face found
beauti death
In dead men breath

goliath and david

for dct kill AT fricourt march



yet earlier david took
smooth pebbl brook

and young fight philistin
clad brazen mail He swear
that kill lion kill bear
and scorn god zion
shall perish like bear lion
but  historian fight
had heart tell right

stride within javelin rang
goliath marvel strang
goodlyfac boy proud strength
david clear eye measur length
with hand thrust back cramp one knee

and hurl long veng swing

like wild bee fli sure line
for forehead philistin
then  come brazen clink
and quicker man think
goliath shield parri cast
clang clang clang david last
scorn blaze giant eye
tower unhurt six cubit high
say foolish david damn shield
and damn sling ll yield
He take staff mamr oak

To rout david calm brave

Of timor heart linger

pinch OF salt

when dream born
with sudden clamor pain
when know dream true

Of magic keep safe rhyme
In heaven beyond time

the bough OF nonsens

An idyl

through great oak see famou bough

where nonsens built nest

In old boot patient breast

We ll sit weav nonsens hymn

In deep grove hush dim
s To gloriou yellowbunch bananatre

s which men wise beyond time
and worship nonsens one
r hard among old quinc lime
they ve built templ floor
s and whosoev worship place
He disappear sight leav trace

r onc galatian built fane
To sens duller god
s but first day autumn rain
the roof fell crush flat
r Ay roof subtlest logic fall
when nonsens foundat wall


tell old galatian tale
He cap quick portugues
while phantom creatur green scale
scrambl roll among tree
the hymn swell bough us sing
row bright pink bird flap wing

My window frame forest heather
hardli hear tune babbl
not know much care whether
the text prais exhort
prayer thanksgiv damnat

outsid blow wetter wetter
the toss tree never stay still
shift elbow catch better
the full round sweep heather hill
the tortur cops bend fro
In silenc like shadowshow

the parson voic run like river
over smooth rock like church
the pew staid never shiver
they never bend sway lurch
prayer say kind voic chain
that draw grace heaven

add hymn
until least mistak

It gone who saint lake
the red light mantl pass
across broad memori brass

It pleasant dream think

sad prayer forgiv god
but dumb blast set tree sway
with furiou zeal like madmen pray




corpor stare

back line one night june
gave dinner bethun
seven cours gorgeou meal
money could buy batman steal
five hungri lad welcom fish
with shout nearli crack dish
asparagu came tender top
strawberri cream mutton chop
said jenkin hand shook
they ll put histori book
We bawl church anthem in choro
Of bethlehem hermon snow
with drink song jolli sound
To help good red pommard round
stori laughter interspers
We drown long La basse thirst
trench june make throat damn dri
then window suddenli

We saw swagger street
just like live man corpor stare
stare kill last may festubert
caught patrol near boch wire
tom horribl machinegun fire
He paus salut smartli grin
then pass away like puff wind
leav us blank astonish
the song broke start leant
out window noth
not least shadow corpor stare
onli quiver smoke show
fagend drop silent road




the assault heroic

down mud lay
tire long day
Of five damn day night
five sleepless day night
dreamsnatch set
the dungeon despair
loom desol sea
frown threaten
with aspect high steep
malign keep
My foe lay within
shout made din
hoot grin cri
today ve kill pride
today ardour end
We ve murder friend
We ve undermin stealth
your happi health
We ve taken away hope
now may droop mope
To miseri death
but spear faith
stout oaken rafter
with round shield laughter
with sharp tonguelik sword
that speak bitter word
stood beneath wall
and defi
the stone cast caught
and alchem thought
into lump gold
As dream miser hold
the boil oil threw
fell shower dew
refresh spear
flew harmless ear
struck quiver sod
there like prophet rod
put leav took firm root
and bore instant fruit
My foe astound
dumbstricken confound
gape long row
they dare thrust throw
thu climb steep
buttress keep
and laugh proudli blew
My horn  stand stand
wake sir here new
attack stand stand




the poet IN the nurseri

the youngest poet shelv fumbl
In dim librari behind chair
from ancient poet mummumbl
song lover fair
pull long white beard gentli grumbl
that rhyme beastli thing never

and grope whole time think
about tragic poem d write
An old man life beer whiski drink
hi year kidnap wick fight
and last fever sink
remors die bedcloth bite

but suddenli saw bright green cover
Of thin pretti book right
snatch turn page
To find full poetri
put neck quick hand like lover
and turn watch old man saw go

the book full funni muddl maze
each round love song
and extraordinari monstrou phrase
knot rhyme like slavedriv thong
and metr twist like chain daisi
with great big splendid word sentenc long

took book bed gloat
learn line seem sound grand
So soon pretti emerald green coat
with jam greasi mark hot hand
while round nurseri long month float
wonder word one could understand




IN the wilder

christ hi gentl
thirst hunger
walk wilder
soft word grace He spoke
unto lost desertfolk
that listen wonder
He heard bittern call
from ruin palacewal
answer brotherli
He held communion
with shepelican
Of lone pieti
basilisk cockatric
flock homili
with mail dread devic
with monstrou barb sling
with eager dragoney
great rat leather wing
and poor blind broken thing
foul miseri
and ever him went
Of hi wander
comrad rag coat
gaunt rib poor innoc
bleed foot burn throat
the guileless old scapegoat
for forti night day
follow jesu way
sure guard behind him kept
tear like lover wept
