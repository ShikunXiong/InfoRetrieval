On wretch hath mingl wormwood gall
and gain like mildew shall blight destroy

Of hellbegotten slaveri

and clank fetter round mountain

Go ye grind dust

wring sinew gold accurs
and boast gospel warm mild

while mountain top pine
In freedom green branch wave
her son shall never stoop bind
the gall shackl slave

Ye dare demand haughti tone
for us pander shame
To give brother alon
To feel lash wear chain

our brother never shall go back
when press free shore
though souther power hell back

No rather starri land

upon free hill ll stand
and pour upon breez heaven

ere slumber chain bound
when silveri light
the moon pour round
beneath ray kneel pray
that god would give token
that slaveri chain southern plain
shall ere long broken

though slaveri chain bound
kneel feel might
Of god right arm around

when driver call
In cold sultri weather
We slave great small
turn toil togeth
feel like one sun
Of hope long depart
and morn light weari night
still find broken heart
thu chilli breath
Of night sigh round
kneel wish death
In cold chain bound
