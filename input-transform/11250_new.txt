O around us
As lesser god made world
but forc shape would
till high god behold beyond

Or els world wholli fair

On wast sand wast sea close

whereof chill breath drew

and friend slew friend know slew
and vision golden youth
and beheld face old ghost

Of battleax shatter d helm shriek

then spake king arthur sir bediver
and whiter mist day long

hearest thou great voic shake world
and wast narrow realm whereon move
and beat upon face dead
My dead tho die
O bediver heart hath fall n

then spake bold sir bediver My king

there also worship thee king
yet still thi life whole still live
who love thee hate thee brought
the heathen back among us yonder stand

then spake king My hous hath doom
but call thou traitor hous
who hath dwelt beneath one roof
My hous rather sware vow
yea even break d king
and well thee say dark hour
when purport throne hath fail
that quick dead thou holdest king
king whatsoev cri
and one last act kinghood shalt thou see

So day long nois battl roll d
among mountain winter sea
until king arthur tabl man man
had fall n lyonness lord
king arthur then wound deep
the bold sir bediver uplift
and bore chapel nigh field
broken chancel broken cross
that stood dark strait barren land
On one side lay ocean one
lay great water moon full

then spake king arthur sir bediver
the sequel today unsold
the goodliest fellowship famou knight
whereof world hold record such sleep
they sleep men love think

Of camelot day

tho merlin sware come
To rule let
deepli smitten thro helm
that without help last till morn
thou therefor take brand excalibur
which pride thou rememberest
In old day one summer noon arm

and took worn like king
and wheresoev sung told
In aftertim also shall known
but delay take excalibur
and fling far middl mere

footnot mere poetic word lake

To repli bold sir bediver

watch see lightli bring thee word

So say ruin d shrine stept
and moon athwart place tomb
where lay mighti bone ancient men
old knight seawind sang
shrill chill flake foam He step
By zigzag path jut point rock
came shine level lake

there drew forth brand excalibur
and oer draw winter moon
brighten skirt long cloud ran forth
and sparkl keen frost hilt

Of subtlest jewelri He gaze long

So strode back slow wound king

then spake king arthur sir bediver
hast thou perform d mission gave

and answer made bold sir bediver
heard rippl wash reed

To repli king arthur faint pale
thou hast betray d thi natur thi name

for surer sign follow d either hand
Or voic els motion mere

footnot lief old word mean beloved

then went sir bediver second time
across bridg pace besid mere

but saw wonder hilt
how curious strang chase smote
hi palm togeth cri aloud

and inde cast brand away
sure preciou thing one worthi note
should thu lost ever earth
which might pleas eye mani men
what good follow done

see obedi bond rule
were well obey king demand
An act unprofit
the king sick know
what record relic lord
should aftertim empti breath
and rumor doubt but kept
store treasurehous mighti king
some one might show joust arm
say king arthur sword excalibur
wrought lone maiden lake
nine year wrought sit deep
upon hidden base hill
So might old man speak aftertim
To peopl win rever
but much honor much fame lost

So spake cloud conceit
and hid excalibur second time
and strode back slow wound king

footnot conceit mean fancy

then spoke king arthur breath heavili
what thou hast seen hast heard

and answer made bold sir bediver
heard water lap crag
and long rippl wash reed

To repli king arthur much wrath
Ah miser unkind untru

and third time may prosper get thee henc
but thou spare fling excalibur

then quickli rose sir bediver ran
and leap ridg lightli plung

and strongli wheel d threw the great brand

and flash round round whirl d arch
shot like streamer northern morn

So flash d fell brand excalibur
but ere dipt surfac rose arm

then spoke king arthur draw thicker breath
now see thine eye done

and answer made bold sir bediver
sir king close mine eyelid lest gem

So great miracl yonder hilt
then hand flung wheel
but look behold arm

and answer made king arthur breath hard
My end draw nigh t time gone
make broad thi shoulder receiv weight
and bear margin yet fear
My wound hath taken cold shall die

So say pavement half rose

and look wist wide blue eye
As pictur him sir bediver
remors regard thro tear
and would spoken found word
then took care kneel one knee
oer shoulder drew languid hand
and rise bore thro place tomb

bruce and the spider


by bernard arton

for scotland freedom right
the bruce part play
In five success field fight
been conquer dismay
onc english host
hi band led lost
the meed fought
and battl faint worn
the homeless fugit forlorn
hut lone shelter sought

and cheerless rest place
for claim throne
hi canopi devoid grace
the rude rough beam alon
the heather couch bed
yet well ween slumber fled
from couch eider
through darksom night till dawn day
absorb wake thought lay
Of scotland crown

the sun rose brightli gleam
fell hapless bed
and ting light shapeless beam
which roof lowli shed
when look wist eye
the bruce beheld spider tri
hi filmi thread fling
from beam beam rude cot
and well insect toilsom lot
taught scotland futur king

six time gossameri thread
the wari spider threw

illustr bruce beheld spider

In vain filmi line sped
for powerless untru
each aim appear back recoil
the patient insect six time foil
and yet unconqu still
and soon bruce eager eye
saw prepar tri
hi courag strength skill

one effort seventh last
the hero hail sign
and wishedfor beam hung fast
that slender silken line
slight spirit caught
the omen thought
the lesson well could trace
which even run may read
that persever gain meed
and patienc win race





the heart OF bruce

by william L aytoun

It upon april morn
while yet frost lay hoar
We heard lord jame bugl horn
sound rocki shore

then went hundr
knight
all dark array
and flung armor ship
that rode within bay

We spoke shore grew less
but gaze silenc back
where long billow swept away
the foam behind track

and aye purpl hue decay
upon fade hill
and one heart ship
wa tranquil cold still

the good lord dougla pace deck
and O face wan
unlik flush use wear
when battlevan

come hither come hither trusti knight
sir simon lee
there freit lie near soul
fain would tell thee

thou knowst word king robert spoke
upon die day
how bade take nobl heart
and carri far away

and lay holi soil
where saviour trod
sinc might bear bless cross
nor strike one blow god

last night bed lay
dream dreari dream
methought saw pilgrim stand
In moonlight quiver beam

hi robe azur dye
snowwhit scatter hair
and even cross bore
As good saint andrew bear

whi go ye forth lord jame said
with spear belt brand
whi take dearest pledg
from scottish land

the sultri breez galile
creep grove palm
the oliv holi mount
stand glitter calm

but t scotland heart
shall rest god decre
till great angel call dead
To rise earth sea

lord jame dougla mark rede
that heart shall pass
In fieri fight foe
As wont yore

and shall pass beneath cross
and save king robert vow
but hand shall bear back
not jame dougla thou

now thi knightli faith pray
sir simon lee
for truer friend never man
than thou hast

If neer upon holi land
T mine life tread
bear thou scotland kindli earth
the relic dead

the tear sir simon eye
As wrung warrior hand
betid weal betid woe
ll hold thi command

but battlefront lord jame
T ride
nor forc man craft fiend
shall cleav thi side

illustr saw pilgrim stand

and aye sail aye sail
across weari sea
until one morn coast spain
rose grimli lee

and round port
beneath watchtow wall
We heard clash atab
and trumpet waver call

whi sound yon eastern music
So wantonli long
and whose crowd arm men
that round yon standard throng

the moor come africa
To spoil wast slay
and king alonzo castil
must fight today

now shame cri good lord jame
shall never said
that mine turn asid
from cross jeopardi

have merri men
have unto plain
We ll let scottish lion loos
within field spain

now welcom nobl lord
thou thi stalwart power
dear sight christian knight
who come hour

Is bond faith come
Or yet golden fee
Or bring ye franc lili
Or flower burgundi

god greet thee well thou valiant king

sir jame dougla call
and scottish spear

We fight bond plight
nor yet golden fee
but sake bless lord
who die upon tree

We bring great king robert heart
across welter wave
To lay holi soil
hard saviour grave

true pilgrim land sea
where danger bar way
and therefor lord king
To ride thee day

the king bent state head
and tear eyn
god bless thee nobl knight
for brave thought thine

know thi name full well lord jame
and honor may
that fought besid bruce
should fight day

take thou lead van
and charg moor amain
there lanc thine
In host spain

the dougla turn toward us
O glanc high
there one men
but bold

there one knight
but bear true spear
then onward scottish gentlemen
and think king robert

the trumpet blew crossbolt flew
the arrow flash like flame
As spur side spear rest
against foe came

and mani beard saracen
went hors man
for rank rode like corn
So furious ran

but behind path close
though fain let us
for forti thousand men
and wondrou

We might see lanc length
So dens array
but long fell sweep scottish blade
still held hard bay

make make lord dougla cri
make brethren dear
sir william saint clair
We may leav

but thicker thicker grew swarm
and sharper shot rain
and hors rear amid press
but would charg

now jesu help thee said lord jame
thou kind true saint clair
An may bring thee
ll die besid thee

then stirrup stood
So lionlik bold
and held preciou heart aloft
all case gold

He flung far ahead
and never spake
but pass thou first thou dauntless heart
As thou wert wont yore

the roar fight rose fiercer yet
and heavier still stour
till spear spain came shiver
and swept away moor

now prais god day
they fli oer flood fell
whi dost thou draw rein hard
good knight fought well

O ride ye lord king said
and leav dead
for must keep dreariest watch
that ever shall dree

there lie master heart
the dougla stark grim
and woe
not side side

the world grow cold arm old
and thin lyart hair
and love best earth
Is stretch

O bothwel bank bloom bright
beneath sun may
the heaviest cloud ever blew
Is bound day

and scotland thou mayst veil thi head
In sorrow pain
the sorest stroke upon thi brow
hath fallen day spain

We ll bear back unto ship
We ll bear oer sea
and lay hallow earth
within countri

illustr held the heart aloft

and thou strong heart lord king
for tell thee sure
the sod drank dougla blood
shall never bear moor

the king light hors
He flung brand away
and took dougla hand
So state lay

god give thee rest thou valiant soul
that fought well spain
d rather half land gone
So thou wert

We bore good lord jame away
and priceless heart bore
and heavili steer ship
toward scottish shore

No welcom greet return
nor clang martial tread
but dumb hush death
befor mighti dead

We laid chief dougla kirk
the heart fair melros
and woful men day
god grant soul repos

when freedom mountain height
unfurl standard air
she tore azur robe night
and set star glori

and stripe pure celesti white
with streak morn light
then mansion sun
she call eagl bearer
and gave mighti hand

majest monarch cloud
who rearst aloft thi regal form
To hear tempesttrump loud
and see lightn lanc driven
when strive warrior storm
and roll thunderdrum heaven
child sun thee t given
To guard banner free
To hover sulphur smoke
To ward away battlestrok
and bid blend shine afar
like rainbow cloud war
the harbing victori

flag brave thi fold shall fli
the sign hope triumph high
when speak signaltrumpet tone
and long line come gleam
ere yet lifeblood warm wet
ha dim glisten bayonet
each soldier eye shall brightli turn
To thi skyborn glori burn
and spring step advanc
catch war vengeanc glanc
and cannonmouth loud
heav wild wreath battl shroud
and gori sabr rise fall
like shoot flame midnight pall
then shall thi meteor glanc glow
and cower foe shall shrink beneath

He hath loos fate lightn terribl swift sword

He sift heart men judgmentseat
O swift soul answer jubil feet

In beauti lili christ born across sea
