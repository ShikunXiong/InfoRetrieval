In blush bud wake soon

desol born time
As distant stormcap tower loom
and shroud sun height sublim

for vanish tree
and vanish throng flower
whose tender tone thrill everi breez
and sped mirth fli hour
No form shape sad eye see
No faith spirit haunt bower

alon alon sun dew
one fled heaven earth afraid
and one earth eye untru
and lip falter passion stray
nor shall strenuou year renew
On bough leav fade

No summer bring dead

and one fair face know
