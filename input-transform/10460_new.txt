Of humbl servic simpl thing

fanci everi fellow faith must satisfi need
Or would hunt someth els An ca nt tell
An wherefor doctrin deep nt tri
reckon life done know hi plan
god wo nt hard anyon tri man

My religion nt hing one rite word
hold honest prayer mortal make heard
To love church well enough get cold pride
An quit forget fellowmen saviour die

If god mark sparrow fall nt believ He ll fail
To notic us act doubt fear assail
think He ll hold heart creed
An judg religion record deed
An sinc man god greatest work sinc life earth began
He ll get heaven believ help fellowman




what call live


the miser think live hoard gold
the soldier call live someth bold
the sailor think live toss upon sea
and upon vital subject two us agre
but hold opinion walk way along
that live made laughter goodfellowship song

would nt call live alway seek gold
To bank present glad day ll old
would nt call live spend strength fame
and forego mani pleasur today mine claim
would nt splendor world set roam
and forsak laugh children peac know home
Oh thing call live nt gold fame

how foolish would struggl seem
how grim earth would

If live whole life

there d faith keep us true
No hope keep us strong
and fool would cherish dream
No smile would last long

how purposeless strife would
If noth
If plan serv
An end struggl
No reason mortal birth
except die
how silli goal would seem
for men brave tri

there must someth death
behind toil man
there must exist god divin
who work plan
and brief journey know
As life must realli
the gateway finer world
that day shall see

and guid thee perfect peac
when everi fear doubt shall ceas
and may thi home glori know

forgotten boyhood

the selfsam mischief use
the boyhood left behind
ha strang vanish mind
and old gray cross
for suffer loss
He think never joy

the age ink


swiftli chang come each day
see lost beauti blown away
and new touch love grace
come life take place
the littl babe
one morn woke roguish lad
the babe put bed
out arm live fled

frock vanish castl
neer worn seen
and knickerbock pride
He boast pocket side
and store deep variou thing
stone top jack andcolor string
then time claim joy
Of call littl boy

brief reign spell
one morn sound bell
with tear saw brown eye swim
and knew call
time harsh master us
wa bid heed call
thi shadow fell across life pool
our boy way school

our littl boy and still dream

No littl lip breath prayer
that god shall keep hi care
No glad caress welcom sweet

We never knew love brightest flame
until day babi came

and could get along
without laughter song
joy bottl shelf
It feed upon
and even love shall wear
must find happi care
dull d becom mind speech
had littl one teach
No children hous play
Oh could never live way




the loss Is not So great


It better fail sleep
though pit dark deep
walk tomorrow street meet tomorrow men
unasham face gaze go work

lost hope dust dream
but loss great dread seem
made fight though fail need slink away
for fear anoth man may say

they may call overbold may say frail
they may tell dare much doom last fail
they may talk battl oer discuss choos
but brother wrong m one lose

It better kept selfrespect
walk tomorrow street meet men head erect
No man charg loss pledg keep
shame regret fail sleep

and dust lie thick
On window sill

In solemn tone

and miss toy
In lone hall

and laughter gay

At close day
