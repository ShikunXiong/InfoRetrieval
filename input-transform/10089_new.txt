the wee folk


In knoll greenest
and grey cliff side
and lone bentop
the wee folk bide
they ll flit among heather
and trip upon brae
the wee folk green folk red folk grey

As oer moor midnight
the wee folk pass
they whisper mong rush
and oer green grass
all marshi place
they glint pass away
the light folk lone folk folk stay

O mani fairi milkmaid
with one eye blind
Is mid lone mountain
By red deer hind
not one wait greet
for naught say
the hill folk still folk folk flit away

when golden moon glint
In deep dim wood
there fairi piper play
To elfin brood
they danc shout turn
and laugh swing sway
the droll folk knoll folk folk danc alway

O bless wee folk
have naught fear
and neer elfin arrow
will come us near
for ll give skill music
and everi wish obey
the wise folk peac folk folk work play

they ll hasten harvest
they shear bind
they ll come elfin music
On western wind
all night ll sit among sheav
Or herd kine stray
the quick folk fine folk folk ask pay

betim spin
the sleep
they ll clamber chimney
Or keyhol creep
and come borrow meal
We ll neer send away
the good folk honest folk folk work alway

O never wrong wee folk
the red folk green
nor name friday
Or halloween
the helpless unwari
and bairn lure away
the fierc folk angri folk folk steal slay

O finlay littl bannock
for go well

the bannock brander
smell sweet desir
O crisp one count
On two side fire
and farl fallen
some evil foretel
O finlay littl bannock
for go well

the bread would last
twould crumbl hand
when fairi would come
To turn meal sand
but keep danc
In green dell
O finlay littl bannock
for go well

now fairi finger
will bake harm
the littl bannock hole
O charm
knead knead twixt palm
and bairn tell
O finlay littl bannock
for go well




the banshe


kneedeep wade pool
the banshe robe green
she sang yon song whole night long
and wash linen clean
the linen would wrap dead
she beetl stone
she stood drip hand bloodr
low sing alon

hi linen robe pure white
for fergu more must die tonight

T fergu more rode oer hill
come back foreign war
hi hors feet clatter sweet
below pitiless star
and heart would repeat
O never ll roam
all weari go forth
but sweet come home

hi linen robe pure white
for fergu more must die tonight

He saw blaze upon hearth
come gleam glen
for fain home
and rode men
T mani weari day d sigh
sinc would leav side
ll never leav scotland shore
and yon darkey bride

hi linen robe pure white
for fergu more must die tonight

So dream tender love
soft tear eye would blind
when crept swiftli leapt
man stab behind
T cri stole bride
thi night shall last
when fergu fell warm red tide
Of life came eb fast

hi linen robe pure white
for fergu more must die tonight




conn son OF the red


the fian sojourn shore
Of come cromarti oer
the wood hill pursu chase
with ardour T full moon space
ere beltan rite would begun
with homag rise sun
ere spirit dead
would sacrifici blood shed
In yon green grove naviti
when conn came eastern sea
hi heart aflam veng ire
To seek goll slew sire
when seven year old

finn saw
In dream ere yet came awe
the red one son fierc bold
In combat hero old
the kinglik goll valor might
stormi billow fight
No foe could ere withstand

He knew
the strang ship bore brave conn blew
clear horn warn call
and round throng fian
with wondr gaze

the sun drew nigh
the balefir western sky
and faggot cloud bloodr glare
caught flame radiant air
lone wyvi like jewel shone
the fian stare conn
were stoop high lookout
they watch ship tack
now slant across firth
laid bare cliff broad brow
and heav billowi steep
like monster deep
that wallow labour pain
and conn stare back cold disdain

ponder sat alon behind
the broad sail swallow wind
As hollow wave leapt
and snarl foam lip swept
around bow querul fray
and toss curv drench spray
the belch ship ardour drove
then like lordli elk strove
amid hound charg rent
the pack asund went
It bore round beauti sprang
the seawind cordag sang
with high wintri merriment
that stir heart conn intent
On vengeanc battl keen
So hard steadfast seren

then ossian sweet speech spake low
with muse eye upon foe
Is conn nobl the red
whom goll battl vanquish
the red fiercer conan cri
nay conn nobler finn repli
more come stalwart mightier far
what sayest thou goll man war
then goll made answer steep
nor ceas gaze conn full deep
hi equal never came
across sea alban shore
nor ever peer upon
nobler mightier man conn

the ship flew seaward tack wide
contend wind tide
and upon broad stream track
It baffl hung drift back
with grunt shriek like battl boar
the shock swing blade oar
came sound oer sea

the dusk
grew round twilight like husk
that hold kernel choic keen
cold star impal sky seren
when conn ship slacken tide
drew round wist bay wide
behind headland high snout
the sea like giant whale spout
the salt foam high loud

then sigh
the gasp men day pli
their oar plung sea hand
grown stiff arm like twist band
drawn numbl rose outspent
and stagger bench went
the sail nap quarrel drank
the wind broken gasp sank
with sullen pride upon board
and smote mast shook cord

darkli loom alien land
and darkli lower fian band
for hover shoreland grey
the ship follow round bay
nor sought shelter wood
the shadow fold oer hill
full heavili night fell blind
and laid spell upon wind

the swell water sank sip
and hollow gurgl round ship
the long mast rock dim
soft heaven headland rim

but seamen crouch sleep
conn sat alon reveri deep
and saw maze
the mute process day
In gloom glamour wend fast
hi heart ahung past
again leapt tender boy
To greet sire eager joy
when came wide north sea
enrich spoil victori
then heavili loom fate morn
when tide fall born
from alban shore  again saw
the youth went alon awe
To swear aveng oath
the smoke altar red gore

Ah strang seem
that hour draw nigh
would vengeanc take  and still strang
O sorrow would bring chang
though blood blood spill life
for life taken fierc strife
twill neer recal life long sped
Or break silenc dead

but heard mother wail
onc uplift gale
moan the red neer return
hi cheek sudden passion burn
and darkli frown valiant man
As quiver bodi ran
the lightn impel ire
and impuls fierc desir
that surg consum hate
against world made desol
unceas unreconcil
and ever clamour  like wild
darkdeed wave stun shore
and anguish twilight roar
the hungri passion wide
and glutton deep unsatisfi






the shred dawn beauti spread
it shaft splendour goldenr
high eastern heaven broke
through flake cloud silvern smoke
that burst aflam fold oer fold
let loos ooz flood gold
splash foamless deep lay
tremul clear In fieri play
the rippl beam swept
the seacleft sutor crag seren
broke quiver water bore
the soft reflect shore

the pipe morn sound shrill
through bud wood plain hill
and stir air song wake
the sweetton bird within brake

the fian sheil came
with offer god aflam
and round thrice sunwis went
then nakedkne silenc bent
besid pillar stone

but
brave conn upon ship high prow
hath rais burnish blade high
and call woden tigh
with bold aveng death
Of great sire  In one deep breath
He drain hero draught burn
with valour god turn
hi longsought foe meet  great conn
sweep stoop boat alon
shoreward rapid blade bright
that shower foamrain pearli white
and rip water bend lith
In hollow swirl hiss writh

giant statur rose
straight mast foe
with head thrown high shoulder wide
and level set back pride
hi bare suppl arm long
As shape oar firm thong
hi right hand grasp gleam blade
goldhilt keen bronz made
In leafen shape

with state stride
He cross level sand wide
then shield challeng gave
hi broad sword thundr like wave
for singl combat

brazen helmet head
flash fire cheek white red
and fian watch awe
that hero young knot jaw
whose eye set deep blue hard
survey rank cold regard
while broad forehead seam care

with ponder oer mysteri

the eye fian sought
heroic groll whose face wrought
with line deep perplex thought
for gaze valiant conn
He mourn youth gone
when strong fierc bold shed
the lifeblood boast red
whom none save would meet He heard
the challeng spake stir
nor fear grown old hate
and lust glori satiat
hi heart took pride conn share

To meet vike bold

Of one man fear

Of bold youth the red

He clutch sword left hand
while round hero band

hi valour  mute goll  they rais

To urg victori

the oneey goll went forth alon
hi face like mountain stone
cold hard grey deepdrawn breath
came heavili like man nigh death
but firm mouth lip drawn thin
deep sunken wrinkl skin
wa cunningli crook hair white
On bald forehead gleam bright
and livid scar conn great sire
had cloven sword struck fire
burli dauntless full might
old goll went humbl forth fight
with arrog conn  It seem the red
In greater might dead

deep
swift silenc fell like sudden sleep
On fian wait
In sharp suspens half despair
the morn still skylark hung
In midair fluttr sung
lullabi grew sweet
amid still heat
and splendour sun lisp
Of faint wind herbag crisp
went past around bare
and foamstrip sandbank gleam fair
the faintlyp wave cast
By wan deep fatigu vast

O great conn dread hour
and fian fear power
and watch darksom dream

Of swift uplift sword

Of conn fierc blow baffl goll
On sword shield resound rang
while old warrior stoop sprang
sideway swerv backward leapt
As swiftli bronz blade swept

To blind blow fell

for goll calm great conn rage
As hour hour conflict wage
He blastdefi tree

and fian one mind

In swift blustr flight At noon

round ossian would gather night
beseech song  and took
hi clarsach magic string shook
maze trembl music fall sweet
As mossi water summer heat
and soft faint moorwind leav
the fume myrtl dewi eve
bound flush d teem tarn night hear
low elfin pipe woodland near

T thu sang love dream
the fair maid sigh hear but theme
wa long chase finn men
follow lightsom heart glen glen
hi song free morn clear loud
As skylark carol cloud
In sweet june weather  and heard fall
Of mountain stream huntsman windi call
across heav hill bay hound
among rock echo answer round
they heard share glad chase

He sang glori fian race
whose fame flash alba far wide
their valor deed sang joy pride
when dark foemen west came oer
the rag hill croumba shore
the vike hord descend fought fled
and brave conn would aveng red
By oneey goll slain Of finn sang
and dermaid clash conflict rang
In billowi music hero hall
and mani fian gave battlecal
when ossian sang

haggard old slow
and faltr step went winter snow
As dreari round would neer done
the last long winter day begun
ere yet latest flush fall leav
had fade breath chill eve
nor end day longer light
when dawn eve encroach upon night
weari time the long strath lay
snowwreath pathless day day
the tempest rave across lowr sky
and grew weak pale hollow eye
the store shrank low wait dawn
Of sweet season woodland wan
fresh flower flutter wild bird sing
for winter forelock spring
it ici finger laid the huntsmen pine
In dim dwell wearili confin
while loud hungri tempest held sway
the redey wolv grew bold came day
and bird fell frozen snow

then
the trackless strath balmi south wind blew
To usher lusti spring Lo night
the snow gan shrink upon plain height
and morn broke bright sound
Of fall water peac profound
possess world around blue
bare heaven  then fian knew
that winter spell broken one
made glad obeis golden sun

three day around knockfarrel pursu

but meagr burden bore
At even dwell To west
but sorrow said finn dismay d
they hasten drear bootless quest
with weari step turn stockad
tomorrow hunt toward east
To high dunskaith make gladsom feast
By night return

Or ever morn
had broken finn aros horn
blew loud huntsman blast round ben
wa echo oer oer  then men

what dim forebod fill heart drew
hi brow furrow care hi eye agleam
still stare upon horror dream
Of evil omen vain sought

As garri spake Be thou ward
strong son morna like thee guard
our women peril  garri turn
from finn sullen silenc yearn
To join chase In statur
wa least tribe none could
more fierc conflict fight van
than grim wolfish misshapen man

then finn caoilt spake gave command
To hasten forth fian band

He sped find foemen come near
fierc swarthi hillmen wait ford
for combat eager red vike hord

Of fierc wound then stream blood

Of steep scourvullin garri lay hide

An evil omen magician saith

As morn crept chamber black

To fair emania fate day
where forsworn fight great cuchullin lay

He fain would pass leapt upon ground

with spell poison cook d hound
Of forbidden partak

for O cuchullin couldst thou ere forget
when fast culann fort yon black night
