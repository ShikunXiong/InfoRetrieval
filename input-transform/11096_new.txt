poet nativ land said
the life good virtuou lead earth
Is like blackey maiden east
who paint lid look bright fair

she love pleas behold face

and song thought divin
but sad experi thi life dipt deep
In thine tear trace natur page
To pleas teach world two dear one

T said life give one moment joy
To one lone mortal live vain
but live like thine god grant shine light
that dark him aright may see
nay live ill beset
Do shine better teach hi way
ala thourt gone wert kind one
obscur stranger distant land
accept wreath uncouth word
which half express grief feel




seeta and rama

tale OF the indian famin


It far loveliest scene ind
deep sunk lone vale tween verdant hill
that etern friendship seem hold

dark shadi grove haunt shepherd boy
and weari peasant midday noon
lake shone lustr clear bright
like pure indian diamond set amidst

it richest land belov men
their friend time need guid life
partak joy woe well
the arbit petti strife
By friend villag master live
that door group children taught
man well vers ancient lore
and oft night end toil
the villag soul enraptur heard
In fieri accent speak krishna deed
and rama warlik skill wonder
He knew well deiti ador
one daughter schoolmast
and seeta name prettiest maid
In villag nurs fond care
Of indulg sire love
the tender feel pure love inspir
By rich villag son heir
Of father wealth best school
the boldest villag youth play
and delight saw
and seem fit pair oft
the secret whisper round villag ran
that seeta wed rich man son
thu eden blest inmat live
and pass day villag field
their busi women blaze hearth
the villag master cottag door
and rama fair seeta true love

hither monster came slowli suck
the vigour life krishnapor
the brilliant lustr diamond lake
the emerald green wave field
the shadi grove pleasant cottag ground
and beauti happi vale
soon vanish impercept
some unconsum furnac underneath
had bake earth render bare
until inmat wander desol
with hollow cheek sunk eye haggard face
like walk skeleton past oer skin
No would bloom girl pitcher laden
repair clear lake curl smoke
rose cottag roof morn
would rama first school see
hi seeta deck father hous flower
No eve villag master pour
from hindu lore mighti deed god
To delight ear simpl men
for left land dear home
and seeta father left cot
and cast behind deep heavi sigh
one lingr look upon vale
wa born fondli nurs glide
her day pleasur pure innoc
where rama live love tenderli
her father die hunger way
and lone creatur wander street
Of town door door vainli beg
for food till deep move sad tale
Of lone straggler safe lodg
famin camp heavi laden
doubl sorrow lover
she thought die tediou life spent
and day week month thu roll away
until last love dead youth
mysteri wane like shallow lamp
burnt breast noth feed

one day news went famin shed
that lean youth pluck arm
Of cruel death tenderli nurs
and inmat hurri scene
poor seeta saw youth sad sight
she neer forgot youth mind
too firmli root root
who evri day strength beauti grew till

first piti youth love
mysteri came last
the flickr flame shone sudden breast
thi stranger must wed love

the face dearli love see
appear evri day upon face
As magic wrought beauti
were seat dead rama face thu muse
thi maiden camp fair youth
thu kindl breast hidden flame
Of love fed ever new strength
which shone puriti

As moon whose effulg hidden lie
when dim cloud suddenli blaze forth
and wont beauti shine
what time dart cloudless vault
So shone love seeta breast
the lamp love cloud sorrow dim
the smother passion suddenli blaze forth
In brighter lustr return
with doubl forc flame fire
Is smother fuel thrown
and straightway flame give brighter light

At last monster left land camp
wa broke inmat left home
england would one thi son
To hear word bless burst
their inward heart nurs
from estrang pour thine arm
poor seeta hasten youth love
and gladden heart thu spake
her rosi lip ope speak like
halfblown rosebud blossom
such magic wrought ere spake
kind stranger whither goest thou
lone maiden friend none
and thee alon trust safe guid
To krishnapor
dear maid thi sorrow ceas
My way lie krishnapor fear
shall restor thee thi home friend
trust safe guid dearest friend
she overjoy recount youth
her tale father hope
and pride reluct left nativ vale
and cottag home die way
and lone creatur wander
the street door door beg food
how taken famin camp
how hollow cheek sunken eye
wa brought one day nurs tenderli
and beauti evri day grew
until like dead rama appear
the villag youth unabl
now suppress suddenli exclaim
look whose name arm tattoo

So say intent gaze

As rich mine pour forth hidden wealth
To delight day night

So love pair deep mine feel
what honey word escap lip
To intens joy better far
the treasur ampl mine bestow
with sweet talk beguil tediou way
the verdant hill sublim rose view
the broad lake glitter diamondlik
and wreath smoke curl cottag roof
the love vale becam love vale
again long forgotten scene
In quick success flow
and never happier marriag seen
In happi vale krishnapor




the stori OF princ desing


It month may gloriou rose
the sun jinji bath light
her lofti hill ancient wall tower
her battlement glitter scene
that bade stranger tell live princ
and greet late long slept
upon ocean bed eager crowd
that best attir earli dawn
fast gather hamlet far wide
and like hive swarm castl hill

perhap villag poet wait
who day night toil hard metr rare
To sing deed virtu princ
and trace leav lone palm
which stood close humbl cottag home
perhap face bespok deep grief
troop farmer come tell
To sportlov princ havoc wrought
upon toil cattl wild beast
that nightli hill abod came
To feast and motley crowd

who long wait mere glimps
Of ruler dese hold court

but soon echo lofti hill
the sound th indian bugl drum
proclaim arriv princ
and often new flood rush
with still water sleep stream
leav nought behind vacanc
Or dim light shallow lamp
suddenli blaze forth soon quench
So louder rose clamour crowd
At sound bugl drum
then straightway deep silenc die away
and perfect still reign everywher

upon gorgeou throne sat jinji princ
with servant fan either side
and place honour sate
capaci hall holi brahmin priest
the master welltrain armi
the chief trust minster state
the age poet prais sang
the sage vers starri lore
hi royal master fortun daili told
the painter adorn ancient wall
and countless servant princ
there gather accustom seat

then gate approach trusti page
and said fold hand trembl lip
O royal master gate wait
man nobl mien far north
request audienc affair state
conduct presenc said princ
the stranger came upon floor knelt
and said thou mighti princ fair land
come arcot nabob sent
hi humbl servant demand thee
thi due five year thou hast paid
know duli paid
from thee broad dominion wrest
and give rule obey
the angri princ made answer Go tell

So say royal seat rose
and palac instantli withdrew

As stone drop middl
placid pool slumbr water wake
and calm surfac ruffl seen
Or merest touch ruthless man
bent honey treasur hive
those myriad one leav murmr foe
their hoard wealth fondli clung
So scatter distant nativ home
the bustl crowd met jinji hill
when arcot came mar joy

and day month roll one day
To dese came loyal spi said
My nobl ruler side
Of fair stream run yonder plain
there wait foe arcot men
prepar go meet field
T even time warrior princ soon wrote
To mamood khan master troop
To hasten countri duti first
what though soldier bridal hour
when receiv royal master call
My countri welfar first fair spous
He said leapt upon faith steed
and stood ere morn streak eastern sky
befor lord bid obey

the princ rose earli fate day
and templ god repair
there invok hi bless field
then palac hasten meet
ere went forth fight youth wife
who day day beauti grew amidst

So fondli stoop jinji nobl princ
To kiss jewel arm fair spous

wa drawn cruel hand hid thee view
So wondrou fair arm look methink
rare beauti must seat thi face
My foe hath come fear go fight
and come honour load field
victor rejoic thee tonight
At propiti hour aid
Of starri lore brahmin sage
hath nuptial name gaze scan
In silent joy charm beauti rare
the hand divin shower upon thi face
and recount thee thine
My arm friendship play blood shed
what havoc moslem camp wrought
So let depart To queen
daughter sire
and cradl sinewi arm grew

went husband side fight
and one nurs fear moslem foe
but ala evil forebod
that thou shouldst day go forth fight

and spoke tear trickl eye
and one pearli drop stole palm
she felt instantli hand withdrew
and began speak word like
It meet jinji valiant princ
should like child last hour shed tear
and fear meet foe fear lord
To meet like soldier field
If thou victor comest fight
We shall joy spend first nuptial night
but thou comest rout field
never see thi timid face
Or think thou art born kshatriya race
and thou fallest brave fight
rememb princ thou hast wife
who let thee pass earth alon
Go forth like warrior meet foe
but fear runga side
So ere thou goest kiss hand mine
which thine eye preciou tear sought
So say brave rajput girl
To dese offer screen hand
He lift rever kiss
then salli forth resolv win die

fierc rage battl hapless princ
wa weak meet foeman myriad host
and mamood khan fell brave light
and mani valiant men
the faith steed peril bore
the princ slain soon fought foot
but ere foe could captur aliv
He hurl heavi dagger bare breast
and instantli lifeless corps fell
brave soldier bore field
they hasten castl
the widow queen preciou burden laid
she noth daunt order gave
that attend prepar pyre
and assembl men thu spake
My faith men brave soldier

T god will thu end live
but wors fate shall sure soon befal
our cruel foe howe exult

when farthest end vast globe

and everywher son son son

Be wit curs pronounc

then bride glori deck

Th expect bridegroom nuptial bed
een ascend fair queen pyre
and embrac lay dear lord

and speedili ash reduc
the lifeless husband live wife
the moslem came heard death die
amid flame repent deed
and said built lordli town
In honour queen count
sin nobl husband surviv
and moment flung life away

No rati never would thi husband bear
To see thee lie anoth man
