Or danger nigh
No none near yet though
Be one much infirm

To leav jovial heart

but sage muse revel heed
No farther stori need
nor servil attend

To quit slowpac waggon side

Of ravencrag black storm

and rove st john vale

By sheeptrack cottag lane

red green blue moment sight
for skiddawtop rosi light
Is touch band take flight

thenc look thou forth oer wood lawn
hoar frostlik dew dawn
across yon meadowi bottom look
where close fog hide parent brook
and see beyond hamlet small

By tree linger twilight made
there blencathara rug feet
sir lancelot gave safe retreat

Or lone highroad star

Of fanci social sens

where franc town lay vibrat
like becalm bark beneath burst
Of heaven immedi thunder cloud
Is visibl shadow main
for thou wert thine brow garland
amid tremor realm aglow
amid mighti nation jubil
when gener heart humankind
hope sprang forth like fullborn deiti
Of dear hope afflict struck
So summon homeward thenceforth calm sure
from dread watchtow man absolut self
with light unwan eye look

Of duti chosen law control choic

A song divin high passion thought
To music chant

Of everendur men the truli great

Of record report swept us
