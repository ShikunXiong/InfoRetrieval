the portent



hang beam
slowli sway law
gaunt shadow green
shenandoah
the cut crown
Lo john brown
and stab shall heal

hidden cap
Is anguish none draw
So futur veil face
shenandoah
but stream beard shown
weird john brown
the meteor war



misgiv



when oceancloud inland hill
sweep storm late autumn brown
and horror sodden valley fill
and spire fall crash town
muse upon countri ill
the tempest burst wast time
On world fairest hope link man foulest crime

natur dark side heed
Ah optimistch dishearten flown
A child may read moodi brow
Of yon black mountain lone
with shout torrent gorg go
and storm form behind storm feel
the hemlock shake rafter oak drive keel



the conflict convict



On starri height
A bugl wail long recal
deris stir deep abyss
heaven omin silenc
return return O eager hope
and face man latter fall
event make dreamer quail
satan old age strong hale
A disciplin captain gray skill
and raphael white enthusiast still
dash aim christ martyr pale
shall mammon slave fulfil

dismantl fort
cut fleet
battl shall
while field fight aeon come
congeal beneath sea

the terror truth dart death
To faith alik vain
though comet gone thousand year
return
patient stand
and wait heed wax hoar

at stoni gate
A statu stone
weed overgrown
long twill wait

but god former mind retain
confirm old decre
the gener inur pain
and strong necess
surg heap time strand wreck
the peopl spread like weedi grass
the thing bring pass
and prosper apoplex
the rout herd around heart
the ghost yield gloom
king wag head now save thyself
who wouldst rebuild world bloom

tidemark
and top age strike
verg call world come
the last advanc life
Ha ha rust iron dome

nay rever hid event
In cloud sword gird
mark twinkl tent
Of michael warrior one
senior wisdom suit
the light youth brow

ay cave miner see
hi forehead bear blink light
dark feebli brave
A meagr wight

but He rule old old
Ah faith warm heaven age cold

ho ho ho ho
the cloister doubt
Of olden time
Is blurt

the ancient day forev young
forev scheme natur thrive
know wind purpos strong
It spin against way drive
what gulf slime foundat bare
So deep must stone hurl
whereon throe age rear
the final empir happier world

the poor old past
the futur slave
she drudg pain crime
To bring bliss prime
then perish there grave

power unanoint may come
dominion unsought free
and iron dome
stronger stress strain
fling huge shadow athwart main
but founder dream shall flee
age age shall
As age age
from man changeless heart way win

and death busi strive
death silent neg

yea and nay
each hath hi say
but god HE keep the middl way
none wa BY
when HE spread the ski
wisdom IS vain and prophesi



apathi enthusiasm





O clammi cold novemb
and winter white dead
and terror dumb stupor
and sky sheet lead
and event came resound
with cri all lost
like thundercrack massi ice
In intens frost
burst one upon anoth
through horror calm
the paralysi arm
In anguish heart
and hollow dearth
the appeal mother
To brother brother
not hatr part
and fissur hearth
grow moment wide
then glanc tween fate
and doubt everi side
and patienc gloom
In stoni wait
the final doom




So winter die despair
and weari week lent
and icebound river melt
and tomb faith rent
O rise peopl
came spring grass
they rebound deject
and easter came pass
and young elat
hear sumter cannon roar
and thought tame nation
In age went
and michael seem gigant
the archfiend dwarf
and tower erebu
our stripl flung scoff
but elder forebod
mourn day forev oer
and call forest proverb
the iroquoi old saw
grief everi graybeard
when young indian lead war

To everi larger end
whenc come trust cheer

age find place rear
all war boyish fought boy
the champion enthusiast state
turbid ardor vain joy
not barrenli abat

prepar fate

who forecasteth event
what heart spurn preced
and warn wise
contemn foreclosur surpris

the banner play bugl call
the air blue prodig
No berri parti pleasurewoo
No picnic parti may
ever went less loth
into leafi neighborhood
In bacchic glee file toward fate
moloch uniniti
expect glad surmis
Of battl unknown mysteri
all feel t glori
A raptur sharp though transitori
yet last belaurel stori
So gayli go fight
chat left laugh right

As lightsom file fare

Or shame surviv like adam

A haze dim shadowi shore
As first lampless boat slid silent

A golden grow flame appear

A purpos light show fleet

So far strong phantom cheat

how dread mark near glare

A bale brand hurri torch

seem privat grief engross
grief far mosbi hous lost

the ruddi ember show pale
the soldier best devoir
some coffe cracker one
care servant sought cheer
know know cruel war
but wait even mosbi ll eat bun
the old hearth back anon

but cordial word balm could bring
she sigh kept inward chafe
and seem hate voic glee
joyless tearless soon call
An escort see ladi safe
In yonder house madam re free
and mosby guid

A nightrid eh tighten girth
but bugler note
fling rail fire blaze
sergeant feint told
toward aldi bivouac adieu
after cheeri flame gaze
then back mosbi maze

the moon look tree tip
the scabbard elfin beam
the leader backward cast glanc
proud cavalcad came
A hundr hors bay cream
major look lad advanc
mosbi ll ambul

No doubt doubt hare
first catch cook cook brown
trust catch cri
the ladi letter danc man danc
thi night given leesburg town
He ll wheez guid
that mosbi love danc ride

the ladi ah ladi letter
A lady case
mutter major Ay aunt
write come friday eve
tonight peopl place
At mosbi last fight jubil
A parti give though tablech scant

the major hem then nightrid
We owe one light hous
In town els dark the moth begar
are quit yet dead how
A mute meek mourn littl mous
mosbi wile subtl
but woman wile wile war

tut major craft guil
Ca nt tell ll found wait
softli enter say town
good picket post sure
when crack rifl everi gate
the grayback fire dash
each alley unto mosbi known

now major take dark view
Of moonlight night well well ll see
and smoke whiff gain
the muse sudden ask
what would grand decre
d beat could lee armi
send constabl mosbi men

Ay ay re odd the moon sail
On shadowi land went
name must made print
hum blith colonel doc flask
major drink good content
My pipe enough
one button shine mosbi see

but come A man front
report tree athwart road
Go round time bide
all right go were one stay
for distrust nervou mood
long mile d make ride
through mosbyland Oh guid

then sport surgeon turn
green sash hardli serv night
nor bullet bottl major sigh
against moccasinsnak foe
As seldom come solid fight
they kill vanish grass glide
devil take mosbi hors shi

hold look tree like drag balloon
A globe leav trickeri
My nag right best shi
A movement made hubbub snarl
littl plain blindli steer
the pleiad ambush sli
peep mosbi men sky

As restiv turn sore feel
and cross sleepi full spleen
and curs war fool north south
said one right O bed
O drop woodland green
He drop syllabl leav mouth
mosbi speak undergrowth

speak volley jet flame
men fall saddl like plum tree
hors take fright rein tangl bind
steadi dismount form wood
they go find scarc pleas
their steed tie field behind
and mosbi men like wind

sound recal vain pursu
the enemi scatter wild know
To reunit good time
and follow need divid
To come lone lost crouch foe
mapl hemlock beech lime
are mosbi confeder share crime

major burst bugler small
the fellow left loudon grass
sir slyboot inward bruis
hi voic heard
some watchword ambush pass
Ay sir shoe
We caught mosbi lose

Go go saddledream well
and another cool sir cool
major saw mount sweep
and one hump mistak
and skurri drop wool
A wig go fetch lad need sleep
they ll next see mosbi sheep

come come fall back reform rank
all jackstraw where captain morn
We ve part like boat rage tide
but stayth colonel charg
and come T streak dawn
mosbi wood wide
hist groan crazi ride

As search fallen dawn grew chill
they lay dew Ah hurt much mink
and ye colonel dead calm
that death seem noth even death
the thing deem everi thing heart think
amid wild rose shed balm
careless mosbi lay charm

the major took hand
into friendli clasp bled
A ball heart hand ru
goodbi gaze humid glanc
then hollow reveri said
the weak thing lustihood
but mosbi check mood

where advanc cut heaven
come surgeon wound
the ambul carri
well get go camp
seven prison gone rest care
then thi grief gall
that mosbi ll cast silver ball

Ho turn captain cloud mind
the place escort went shadi
Go search everi closet low high
and barn bin hidden bower
everi covert find ladi
and yet may misjudg ay
women like mosbi mystifi

We ll see Ay captain go speed
surround search live thing
secur done await us
We last turn stay fire cage
If bird flown By crossroad spring
the band rejoin word glare
told had mosbi plot

the weari troop wend
hardli seem prick
forth forest camp
footsor hors jade men
everi backbon felt nick
each eye dim sickroom lamp
all face stamp mosbi stamp

In order due major rode
chaplain surgeon either hand
A riderless hors negro led
In wagon blanket sleeper went
then ambul bleed band
and empti oatbag head
went mosbi men mark dead

what gloom cast
and chang cheer late took
As doubleguard rode
between file moodi men
some sudden conscious brook
Or dread sequel that night blood
disturb even mosbi brotherhood

the flag hors stumbl root
flounder mire clink stone
No rider spake except asid
but wound cramp ambul
It horror hear groan
jerk along woodland ride
while mosbi clan reveri hide

the hospit steward even
who sleeper kept glanc
wa chang late brightblack beard eye
look hearseblack heavi heart
like fag mare could danc
hi grape raisin dri
T mosbi homili man must die

the amber sunset flush camp
As hill eye fed
the picket dumb look wagon dart
A handkerchief wave banner tent
As white ala face dead
who shall wither news impart
the bullet mosbi goe heart heart

they buri lone one lie
lone sentri shot midnight post
A greenwood graveyard hid ken
where sweetfern fling odor nigh
yet held fear gleam ghost
though bride see threescor ten
she dream mosbi men

now halt vers turn asid
the cypress fall athwart way
No joy remain bard sing
and heaviest dole
that heart shall gay
As shall spring
To mosbyland dirg cling

A guest frank companion
when proud formal talk done

In western battl long lay
So near oppos trench pit

As men screen tavern sit

A dare foe befriend well

A darker side doubt

O brave men yield sword
