fond lover ideal fair
My soul elud everywher
Is laps sweet despair
perpetu pilgrim seek ever
baffl enamor find never
each morn cheer chase renew
misl bewild still pursu
not lavish year bought
one steadfast smile sought
but sidelong glanc glimps light
A someth far fine sight
veil voic far thrid strain
and preciou agoni pain
not love love dear wound
and exquisit unrest found

At earli morn saw pass
the lone lake blur quiver glass
her trail veil amber mist
the unbend bead clover kiss
and straight hast waylay
her come willowi way
but swift companion dawn
she left footprint lawn
and arriv gone
alert rang wind shore
her lumin presenc flash
the wildros daisi wet
from light touch trembl yet
faint smile consciou violet
each bush brier rock betray
some tender sign part made
and far flight track
To thunder cataract
oer wall foami ledg broke
she vanish vapori smoke

tonight pace pallid floor
the sparkl wave curl shore
the august moon flush full
the soft low wind liquid lull
the white silent misti realm
the wanblu heaven ghostli elm

To fill bosom fire
and sweet delirium desir
