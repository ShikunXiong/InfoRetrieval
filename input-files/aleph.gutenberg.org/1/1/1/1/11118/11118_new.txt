He said friend If british march
By land sea town tonight
hang lantern aloft belfryarch
Of northchurchtow signallight
one land two sea
and opposit shore
readi ride spread alarm
through everi middlesex villag farm
for countryfolk arm

then said goodnight muffl oar
silent row charlestown shore
just moon rose bay
where swing wide moor lay
the somersett british manofwar
A phantom ship mast spar
across moon like prisonbar
and huge black hulk magnifi
By reflect tide

meanwhil friend alley street
wander watch eager ear
till silenc around hear
the muster men barrackdoor
the sound arm tramp feet
and measur tread grenadi
march boat shore

then climb tower church
Up wooden stair stealthi tread
To belfrychamb overhead
and startl pigeon perch
On sombr rafter round made
mass move shape shade
Up light ladder slender tall
To highest window wall
where paus listen look
A moment roof town
and moonlight flow

beneath churchyard lay dead
In nightencamp hill
wrap silenc deep still
that could hear like sentinel tread
the watch nightwind went
creep along tent tent
and seem whisper all well
A moment feel spell
Of place hour secret dread
Of lone belfri dead
for suddenli thought bent
On shadowi someth far away
where river widen meet bay
A line black bend float
On rise tide like bridg boat

meanwhil impati mount ride
boot spur heavi stride
On opposit shore walk paul rever
now pat hors side
now gaze landscap far near
then impetu stamp earth
and turn tighten saddlegirth
but mostli watch eager search

As rose grave hill
lone spectral sombr still

and lo look belfri height
A glimmer gleam light
He spring saddl bridl turn
but linger gaze till full sight
A second lamp belfri burn

A hurri hoof villagestreet
A shape moonlight bulk dark
and beneath pebbl pass spark
struck steed fli fearless fleet
that and yet gloom light
the fate nation ride night
and spark struck steed flight
kindl land flame heat

It twelv villageclock
when cross bridg medford town
He heard crow cock
and bark farmer dog
and felt damp riverfog
that rise sun goe

It one villageclock
when rode lexington
He saw gild weathercock
swim moonlight pass
and meetinghous window blank bare
gaze spectral glare
As alreadi stood aghast
At bloodi work would look upon

It two villageclock
when came bridg concord town
He heard bleat flock
and twitter bird among tree
and felt breath morningbreez
blow meadow brown
and one safe asleep bed
who bridg would first fall
who day would lie dead
pierc british musketbal

you know rest In book read
how british regular fire fled
how farmer gave ball ball
from behind fenc farmyardwal

then cross field emerg

So night rode paul rever
and night went cri alarm
To everi middlesex villag farm
A cri defianc fear
A voic dark knock door
and word shall echo forevermor

In hour dark peril need

chalki cliff mile sand
rag reef salti cave
and sparkl emerald wave
fade seem stand
myself languid florentin
In heart fair land
and garden cool green
boccaccio enchant place
met pampenea face face
A maid love see
her smile know itali

her hair like coronet
upon grecian forehead set
where one gem glisten sunnili
like venic first seen sea
saw within violet eye
the starlight italian sky
and brow breast hand
the oliv nativ land

and know time
her lip ripe tuscan rhyme
Of love wine danc spread
My mantl almondtre
and beneath rose said
ll hear thi tuscan melodi

heard tale told
In ten dreami day old
when heaven divin offenc
smote florenc pestil
and garden odor shade
the dame decameron
with happi lover stray
To laugh sing sorest need
To lie lili sun
with glint plume golden brede

and whisper ear
the pleasant arno murmur near
the dewi slim chameleon run
through twenti color sun
the breez broke fountain glass
and woke aeolian melodi
and shook scent tree
the bleach lemonblossom grass

the tale forgot tale
A ladi love forlorn
A rosebud nightingal
that bruis bosom thorn
A pot rubi buri deep
A glen corps child asleep
A monk monk
moonlight castlewal
kaleidoscop hint
work farc tragedi

now sweetey tuscan wove
the gild thread romanc
which lost grievou chanc
the one dear woman love
besid seasid nook
close white finger book
halfvex read weep
for petrarch man asleep
and scorn tame cold
she rose wander shore
her winedark draperi fold fold
imprison ivori hand
and ridg granit half sand
she stood look appledor

and wake beheld
seadream mote air
A siren sweet debonair
with wristlet woven color weed
and oblong lucent amber bead
Of seakelp shine hair
and muse dream
the someth us never sleep
but laugh sing moan weep
she turn breast brow
saw tint seem
from kiss new england sun
saw brow breast hand
the oliv sunnier land
she turn lo within eye
the starlight italian sky

most dream dark beyond rang
Of reason oft tell
If born heaven hell
but soul seem strang
that lie summer sea
with dark woman watch
