weav silk ye lyon loom
To deck girl gay delight
the crimson flower battl bloom
and solemn march fill night

weav flag whose bar today
droop heavi oer earli dead
and home garment coars gray
for orphan must earn bread

keep back tune ye viol sweet
that pour delight land
rous dancer restless feet
the trumpet lead warrior band

and ye wage war word
with mystic fame subtl power
Go chatter idl bird
Or teach lesson hour

Ye sibyl art one stern knot
Be offic combin

and destini could fail
the sun darken sky
the etern bloom natur pale
and god truth freedom die

In golden reign charlemaign king
the threeandthirtieth year thereabout
young eginardu bred court
left mothernak posterndoor
had thenc slow degre ascend
first page pension lastli king knight
and secretari yet held step nought
save led princess feet
eldest loveliest regal three
most graciou liabl love
for bertha betroth third
giselia would look upon man
So bend whole heart unto end
He watch wait trust stir fire
the indol interest larg eye
and feel languid hand beat
ere new spring and well play part
slip chanc bribe brush asid
all would stand light
make fast foe sooth feebl friend
but care read ladi love
and young launcelot gain guenover
A foundl uncertain strain
and one morn come bath
He cross princess palacestair
and kiss sweet disarray
nor met death dream eye
He knew hero old romanc
not second surpass

and love tumultu pain
Be love disquietud deep delight
and sharpest sad though knew heart
hi gain instant
and like waterfal one leap
plung pine palm shatter
To wreath mist broken spraybow bright
He love less weari smile
but daytim held aloof strang
hi walk mingl knightli mirth game
solicit avoid alon
aught might make mind
yet strong let world end
He pledg held rhotruda troth

but love led lover thu along
play trick one windi night cold
for eginardu wont
cross quadrangl dark
No faint moonshin sign star
seek princess door welcom found
the knight forgot prudenc love
for lie feet hand
and tell tale knightship empris
and ring war smooth white arm
hi finger slid insati touch
the night grew old still herode
that seen spoke bitter blow
where land seem driven dust
beneath fair pavia wall loup beat
the longobard charlemaign laid
cleav hors rider dusti drought
Of fierc tale drew lip
and silenc lock lover fast long
till great bell crash one dream

the castlebel eginard away
with tremul hast led door
when lo courtyard white fallen snow
while clear night hung star
A dozen step scarc door
A dozen step gulf impass
what done their secret must lie
bare sneer eye first light
she could footstep door
discoveri destruct hand
and thought kiss kiss
when suddenli ladi bend drew
her lover toward halfunwillingli
and shoulder fairli took
who held breath lighten weight
and lightli carri courtyard length
To door like frighten hare
fled back track unto bower
To pant awhil rest safe

but charlemaign king risen night
To look upon memori eas
To read sign ordin realm
the fanolehen cunigosteura
for tith corn confirm
and stamp pommel sword
hear voic court
look window beheld pair

angri king yet laughinghalf view
the strang vagari feat
laugh inde twenti mind call
from inner bedchamb forti forth
who watch night besid monarch bed
with nake sword torch hand
and test loversknot steel fire
but thought tomorrow yet serv
To greet mummer softli window close
and went back corntax

but morn king meet call
Of lord courtier kindr
and squir dame great audienc hall
gather sat king high crown
upon brow beneath draperi
that fell around like cataract
with fleck color cross cancel
and like tree stream
rich carvenwork heavi wreath rose
palm palmirah fruit frondag hung

and high hall held rare strang
for king right hand leoena bow
In cloudlik marbl besid crouch
the tongueless lioness side
and pois second sappho stood
young erexcea head discrown
the anadema horn lyre
and wall hung sequenc long
merlin uterpendragon
with mighti deed day
when world seem lost wreck rout
A wrath crash steed men
the broken battl fight hopelessli
king arthur ten wound head

but gaze appear peer
stern look king court met
the ladi lover midst
spoke lord demand
what merit servant king
forget place trust oath
who bad end hide fault
make use princess realm
As mule beast burden born
upon shoulder winter night
and wind snow death said angri lord
and knight squir minion murmur death
not one discord voic but charlemaign
though foe circul sword
yet king mild graciou exor
blest children one born
To vex flesh like ingrow nail
look kindli trembl pair said
ye eginardu well hast thou deserv
death thing hadst thou love
thou shouldst sought father
protector dispos child
and ask hand lord thine
thi life forfeit take thou
take even two live forfeit one
and thi fair portress wed honor god
love one anoth obey king

thu far legend rhotrud smile
Or lord applaus truli
would applaud first judgment
We noth learn yet still stori live
shine like light across dark old day
wonder glimps woman wit love
and worthi chronicl
who lover dear threw hair
when garden glanc angri blade
Or like pictur frame battlepik
and bristl sword hang view
the palacecourt white fallen snow
the good king lean night
and rhotrud bear eginard back
