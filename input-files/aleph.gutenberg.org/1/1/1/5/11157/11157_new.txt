onc yonder laurel height
the summer flower bud
onc summer golden light
the vale home flood
and grace him
Of everi good giver
We sing upon wood rim
the prais river

it pine wave
the west wind blow
As fair young brissot
beheld seaward flow
and bore memori oer deep
To sooth martyr sad
and fresco troubl sleep
hi prisonwal glad

We know world rich stream
renown song stori
whose music murmur dream
Of human love glori
We know arno bank fair
and rhine castl shadow
and poettun doon ayr
Go sing meadow

but unpictur unsung
By painter poet
our river wait tune tongu
and cun hand show
We know fond sky lean
abov warm bless
and sweet soul undin
awak caress

No fickl sungod hold flock
that graze shore keep
No ici kiss dian mock
the youth besid sleep
our christian river loveth
the beauti human
the heathen stream naiad boast
but man woman

the miner cabin hear
the rippl hear
It whisper soft homesick ear
around settler clear
In sacramento vale corn
Or sante bloom cotton
our river valleyborn
wa never yet forgotten

the drum roll loud bugl fill
the summer air clangor
the warstorm shake solid hill
beneath tread anger
young eye last year smile
now point rifl barrel
and hand stain fruit flower
bear redder stain quarrel

but blue sky smile flower bloom
and river still keep flow
the dear god still rain sun
On good ill bestow
hi pinetre whisper trust wait
hi flower prophesi
that dread chang fate
hi love underli

and thou O mountainborn
We ask wise allott
than firm thi shore
the calm thi water
the cheer light overlay
thi rug slope beauti
To match spirit day
and make joy duti
