It seem sabl night cell
where save ceil fell
An ooz drop silent spell
No sound ever broke

like strang monument stone
upon barren wild
Or like solid profound
the dark seem wall round
A man buri ground
where pyramid pile



then spake sylph spring seren
T thi joyou heart ween
with sympathi shall move
for live melodi
Of bird choral symphoni
first wake thi soul poesi
To pieti love

when thou call vernal breez
and beckon bough bud tree
hast left thi sullen fire
and stretch thee mossi dell
and heard brows wether bell
blith echo rous cell
To swell tinkl choir

Or lure freshscent gale
that woo moor fisher sail
To tempt mighti main
hast watch dim reced shore
now faintli seen ocean oer
like hang cloud
To bound sapphir plain

then wrap night scud bark
that seem selfpois amid dark
through upper air leap
beheld thi fear height
the rapid dolphin azur light

Of homespun stuff could quit shut

Of lifeblood sharpen face

Of ocean wintri shore

A zigzag waver fro

and ere earli bedtim came

and glass clotheslin post

So night long storm roll

In tini spherul trace line
Of natur geometr sign
In starri flake pellicl

and second morn shone
We look upon world unknown
On noth could call
around glisten wonder bent

AN autumn landscap

A silveri sheet space soft hue
A trembl veil gauz stretch athwart
the shadowi hillsid dark forestflank
A sooth quiet brood upon air
and faint sunshin wink drowsi
far sound melt mellow ear bark
the bleat tinkl whistl blast horn
the rattl wagonwheel low
the fowler shot twitter bird
and even hue convers road

To innumer choral orb
send tribut grate prais
In ceaseless anthem toward hi sacr throne

the fall OF the mongaup

struggl along mountain path
We hear amid gloom
like rous giant voic wrath
A deepton sullen boom
emerg platform high
burst sudden startl eye
rock wood water wild rude
A scene savag solitud

swift arrow bow
headlong torrent leap
then tumbl round dazzl snow
and dizzi whirl sweep
then shoot narrow aisl
Of sublim cathedr pile
amidst vast dark grim
It peal everlast hymn

tower upward wild riven
As pile titan hand mock
the distant smile heaven
and blue streak display
branch emerald network braid
So high eagl flight

here column d hemlock point air
their conelik fring green
their trunk hang knot black bare
like spectr oer scene
here lofti crag deep abyss
and aweinspir precipic
there grotto bright waveworn gloss
and carpet velvet moss

No wander ray eer kiss light
thi rockwal sabl pool
spangl foamgem thick white
and slumber deep cool
but yon cataract roar
set sun rainbow crown
Is danc oer dash strife
hope glitter oer storm life

beyond smooth mirror d sheet
So gentli steal along
the rippl murmur sweet
scarc drown wild bee song
the violet grassi side
dip blue chalic tide
and glide oer leafi brink
the deer unfrighten stoop drink

myriad man timemeasur race

from poem

the unknown dead

the rain plash sill
but wind heaven still
and fall dull sound
which thrill us churchyard ground
when first spade drop like lead
upon coffin dead
beyond stream windowpan
see neighbor vane
yet old familiar tower
the bell come muffl shower
what strang unsuspect link
Of feel touch made think
while vacant soul eye
watch gray stoni sky
Of nameless grave battleplain
wash singl winter rain
where beneath virginian hill
and green atlant rill
some water west
A myriad unknown hero rest
Ah chief die see
their flag front victori
Or lifeblood nobl cost
pay battl nobli lost
claim monument bed
the bitterest tear nation shed
beneath yon lone mound spot
By save fond forgot
lie true martyr fight
which strike freedom right
Of patriot zeal pride
the lofti faith die
No grate page shall farther tell
than mani brave fell
and dimli guess
what world world distress
what utter woe despair dearth
their fate brought mani hearth
just sky weep
abov alway sleep
yet hapli hour
their grave like lover bower
and natur self eye unwet
oblivi crimson debt
To owe april grace
laugh gayli oer burialplac
