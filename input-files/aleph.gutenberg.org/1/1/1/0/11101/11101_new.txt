that oer right arm fell
and fold arm across chest
and couch head upon breast
and look askanc christabel

A snake small eye blink dull shi
and ladi eye shrunk head

upon gentl minstrel bard
and said tone abrupt auster
whi braci dost thou loiter
bade thee henc the bard obey
and turn sweet maid
the age knight sir leolin

A fairi thing red round cheek
that alway find never seek
make vision sight
As fill father eye light
and pleasur flow thick fast
upon heart last
must need express love excess
with word unmeant bitter
perhap t pretti forc togeth

To mutter mock broken charm
To dalli wrong harm
perhap t tender pretti
At wild word feel within
A sweet recoil love piti
and world sin
O sorrow shame true
such giddi heart brain
come seldom save rage pain
So talk use




kubla khan

In xanadu kubla khan
A state pleasuredom decre
where alph sacr river ran
through cavern measureless man

So twice five mile fertil ground
with wall tower girdl round

where blossom mani incensebear tree
and forest ancient hill

but oh deep romant chasm slant
down green hill athwart cedarn cover
A savag place holi enchant
As eer beneath wane moon haunt
By woman wail demonlov
and chasm ceaseless turmoil seeth
As earth fast thick pant breath
A mighti fountain moment forc
amid whose swift halfintermit burst
huge fragment vault like rebound hail
Or chaffi grain beneath thresher flail
and mid danc rock ever
It flung moment sacr river
five mile meander mazi motion
through wood dale sacr river ran
then reach cavern measureless man
and sank tumult lifeless ocean
and mid tumult kubla heard far

It miracl rare devic
A sunni pleasuredom cave ice

A damsel dulcim
In vision saw
It abyssinian maid
and dulcim play
sing mount abora
could reviv within

To deep delight twould win
that music loud long
would build dome air
that sunni dome cave ice
and heard see

where like man belov god

A danc wild eer maniac dream
Ye storm round dawn east assembl

the disson ceas seem calm bright
when franc front deepscar gori

while timid look furi glanc

late late yestreen saw new moon
with old moon arm
and fear fear master dear
We shall deadli storm

ballad sir patrick spence





well If bard weatherwis made
the grand old ballad sir patrick spenc
thi night tranquil go henc
unrous wind pli busier trade
than mould yon cloud lazi flake
Or dull sob draft moan rake
upon string aeolian lute
which better far mute
for lo newmoon winterbright
and overspread phantom light
with swim phantom light oerspread
but rim circl silver thread
see old moon lap foretel
the comingon rain squalli blast
and oh even gust swell
and slant nightshow drive loud fast
those sound oft rais whilst awe
and sent soul abroad
might perhap wont impuls give
might startl dull pain make move live





A grief without pang void dark drear
A stifl drowsi unimpass grief
which find natur outlet relief
In word sigh tear
O ladi wan heartless mood
To thought yonder throstl woo
all long eve balmi seren
have gaze western sky
and peculiar tint yellow green
and still gaze blank eye
and thin cloud flake bar
that give away motion star
those star glide behind
now sparkl bedim alway seen
yon crescent moon fix grew
In cloudless starless lake blue
see excel fair
see feel beauti





My genial spirit fail
and avail
To lift smother weight breast
It vain endeavour
though gaze ever
On green light linger west
may hope outward form win
the passion life whose fountain within





O ladi receiv give
and life alon natur live
our wed garment shroud
and would aught behold higher worth

than inanim cold world allow
To poor loveless everanxi crowd
Ah soul must issu forth
A light glori fair lumin cloud
envelop earth
and soul must sent
A sweet potent voic birth
Of sweet sound life element





O pure heart thou needst ask
what strong music soul may
what wherein doth exist
thi light glori fair lumin mist
thi beauti beautymak power
joy virtuou ladi joy neer given
save pure purest hour
life life effluenc cloud shower
joy ladi spirit power
which wed natur us give dower
A new earth new heaven
undreamt sensual proud
joy sweet voic joy lumin cloud
We rejoic
and thenc flow charm ear sight
all melodi echo voic
all colour suffus light





there time though path rough
thi joy within dalli distress
and misfortun stuff
whenc fanci made dream happi
for hope grew round like twine vine
and fruit foliag seem mine

but afflict bow earth
nor care rob mirth
but oh visit
suspend natur gave birth
My shape spirit imagin
for think need must feel
but still patient
and hapli abstrus research steal
from natur natur man
thi sole resourc plan
till suit part infect whole
and almost grown habit soul





henc viper thought coil around mind
realiti dark dream
turn listen wind
which long rave unnot what scream
Of agoni tortur lengthen
that lute sent forth thou wind ravst without
bare crag mountaintairn blast tree
Or pinegrov whither woodman never clomb
Or lone hous long held witch home
methink fitter instrument thee
mad lutanist month shower
Of darkbrown garden peep flower
makst devil yule wors wintri song
the blossom bud timor leav among
thou actor perfect tragic sound
thou mighti poet even frenzi bold
what tellst thou
T rush host rout
with groan trampl men smart wound
At groan pain shudder cold

but hush paus deepest silenc
and nois rush crowd
with groan tremul shudder
It tell anoth tale sound less deep loud
A tale less affright
and temper delight
As otway self frame tender lay
T littl child
upon lonesom wild
not far home hath lost way
and moan low bitter grief fear
and scream loud hope make mother hear





T midnight small thought sleep
full seldom may friend vigil keep
visit gentl sleep wing heal
and may storm mountainbirth

youth and age

vers breez mid blossom stray
where hope clung feed like bee
both mine life went amay
with natur hope poesi
when young

when young Ah woful when
Ah chang twixt now then
thi breath hous built hand
thi bodi grievou wrong
oer aeri cliff glitter sand
how lightli then flash along
like trim skiff unknown yore
On wind lake river wide
that ask aid sail oar
that fear spite wind tide
nought care bodi wind weather
when youth live t togeth

flower love love flowerlik
friendship shelter tree
O joy came showerlik
Of friendship love liberti
ere old

ere old Ah woful ere
which tell youth longer
O youth year mani sweet
T known thou one
ll think fond conceit
It thou art gone
thi vesperbel hath yet toll
and thou wert aye masker bold
what strang disguis hast put
To make believe thou art gone
see lock silveri slip

but springtid blossom thi lip
and tear take sunshin thine eye
life thought think
that youth housem still

dewdrop gem morn

where hope life warn

with oft tediou takingleav
like poor nighrel guest
that may rude dismist
yet hath outstay welcom
and tell jest without smile




work without hope

line compos st februari


all natur seem work slug leav lair
the bee stir bird wing
and winter slumber open air
wear smile face dream spring
and sole unbusi thing
nor honey make pair build sing

yet well ken bank amaranth blow
have trace fount whenc stream nectar flow
bloom O ye amaranth bloom ye may
for ye bloom glide rich stream away
with lip unbrighten wreathless brow stroll
and would learn spell drows soul
work without hope draw nectar siev
and hope without object live




epitaph

stop christian passerbi stop child god
and read gentl breast beneath sod
A poet lie seem he
O lift one thought prayer stc
that mani year toil breath
found death life may find life death
merci prais forgiven fame
He ask d hope christ
Do thou
