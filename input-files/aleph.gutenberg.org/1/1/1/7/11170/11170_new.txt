the shelv eav left ark
but one long strip summer sky
but one long line bless eye
the thin white cloud lay high
onli brown bird skim nigh
from wing whenc dew dri
shook dream forest scent
Of odor bloom sweet content
upon weari passersbi

Ah haggard brow part
below street uneven crown
and murmur mart
swarm faint hum drowsi noon
with voic chime quaint tune
from sunsoak hull long wharv adown
the sing sailor rough brown
won far melodi renown
here listen children ceas play
and mother sad wellaway
In old breezi seaboard town

ablaz distant bank knew
spread bowl catch sun
magnific dutch tulip grew
with pompou color overrun
By light snow heaven
their misti web azalea spun
low lili pale nun
their pensil bell rang one one
and spice summer air
gold honeysuckl everywher
their trumpet blew unison

than bloodcor carnat stood
she fanci richer hue might
scent rarer purpl hood

small skill learn name
yet whatso wealth land sea

some lover foreign clime
some rove gallant main
had brought gay springtim
and told nacar stain
the thing would wear bloom
therefor garden growth vain
their glow rank swept brain
the plant knit subtil chain
To balm southern zone
the incens eastern throne
the tinkl hem aaron train

the almond shake sun
On high place ere day begin
where wind myrrh cinnamon
between toss plume
It call kin
the fragrant savag balaustin
grown ruin ravelin
that tawni leopard couch
but roll sea
It caught saltfum breez
would grace might win

and fruit bring
one globe pictur bright near

all air brush shine sphere
In transluc atmospher
afrit princess reappear
through paint pane scatter spear
Of sunris scarc warm clear
and pulp golden juic
ambrosi one choos
but find thought sumptuou cheer

Of fair women queen
and beauti late soon
oercam like mellow sheen
Of seren autumn noon
her presenc like sweetest tune
accord thought one
than last year aldertuft june
browner yet lustrou moon
her eye glow hair
with air princ wear
she trim blackbraid crown

A perfect peac prepar day
few want small care
No weari thought perplex way
she hardli knew fair

bent lightli needl
In small room stair stair
all fanci blith debonair

all cluster moss drift snow
all trail vine flower blow
her daedal finger laid bare

still slowli spread leav
she glanc ever anon
If yet shadow eav
had pale dark gloss put
but smile like sunlight shone
the life danc blossom blown
that rose ever known
blanch provenc noisett yonn
wore tint pale streak
that damask half round cheek
Of bud great burst grown

and perfect flower lay free
like great moth whose gorgeou wing
fan oer husk unconsci
silken airi balanc
she saw gay dishevel
Of fairi flag whose revel
illumin night enchant ring
So royal red blood king
she thought summer room
seal escutcheon bloom
In glad girl imagin

now said heart wood
the sweet southwind assert power
and blow apart snowi snood
Of trillium thricegreen bower

Of viscid pink hour hour

Of wind sky oer edg
some gaudi petal slowli born
flutter earth careless scorn
caught fallen piec morn
from kindl vapor loos shorn
By urchin rag wayworn
who saw high stone emboss
A laugh face hand toss
A prodig spray freshli torn

what wizard hint across fleet

swift gypsi tortuou street
with childhood yet cheek chin
what voic drop din
An airi murmur begin
these float flake fine thin

brother jonathan S lament for sister carolin


she gone left us passion pride
our stormybrow sister long side
she torn star firmament glow
and turn brother face foe

O carolin carolin child sun
We never forget heart one
our forehead sprinkl liberti name
from fountain blood finger flame

you alway readi fire touch
but said she hasti mean much
We scowl utter turbul threat
but friendship still whisper forgiv forget

ha love die have altar grown cold
ha curs come last father foretold
then natur must teach us strength chain
that petul children would sever vain

they may fight till buzzard gorg spoil
till harvest grow black rot soil
till wolv catamount troop cave
and shark track pirat lord wave

In vain strife when furi past
their fortun must flow one channel last
As torrent rush mountain snow
roll mingl peac valley

our union river lake ocean sky
man break medal god cut die
though darken sulphur though cloven steel
the blue arch brighten water heal

O carolin carolin child sun
there battl fate never
the starflow banner must never furl
for blossom light hope world

Go rash sister afar aloof
run wild sunshin away roof
but heart ach feet grown sore
rememb pathway lead door

judicio meo mihi videtur quod quatuor deduxerunt eam nobilem provinciam
ad tantam desolationem primum est avaritia pastorum ecclesia qui nunc
vendunt unam terram nunc aliam et nunc unu favet uni tyranno nunc
aliu alteri secundum quod saep mutantur official secundum est
pravita tyrannorum suorum qui semper inter se se lacer et rodunt
et subdito excori tertium est fertilita locorum ipsiu provincia
cuju pinguedo allicit barbaro et externo praedam quartum est
invidia quae viget cordibu ipsorum incolarum

tamburini

per ritengo che quattro fossero le cagioni per cui la romagna
si riduss tanta desolazion l abuso per avarizia di alcuni
ecclesiastici che alienarono una un altra terra e si misero
accordo coi tiranni tiranni stessi che sempr erano discordi fra
loro danno de sudditi la fertilita de terreni che troppo alletta
