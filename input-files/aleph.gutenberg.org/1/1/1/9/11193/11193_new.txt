To with arthur albina




Ah eye eer line survey
dismiss thenc penetr ray
let critic distanc keep
and dread justic lull d sleep
for let whatev sentenc due
feel censur bear




A british maid await arriv lover battl
hill commenc retir make vow heaven
success evening






arthur albina


Ah yellow western sky turn pale
and leav cheerless son earth mourn
and yet hear net silent vale
A sound tell arthur return

Ah hast ye hour quick plume loitr wing
bring back hero crown d gloriou spoil
let bard lofti harp triumph sing
and loud applaus repay success toil

reward flame ye great celesti powr
the nobl flame bosom glow
inspir druid holi bowr
with strength conquer ironbreast foe

with heighten d vigour brace nervou arm
and let lanc tenfold furi fli
make terrif potent charm
and add new lighten pierc eye

then may lover gain unrival d fame
the roman banner may less proudli flow
then may humbl detest name
and high plume wave oer british brow

then may chariot wheel oer plain
hurl death desol around
while intrepid front appal train
and make proud invad bite ground

but yet hear live foot advanc
No sound triumph greet listn ear
and may carv eagledart lanc
for one whose voic never shall hear

perhap vow never reach d sky
nor heav n propiti smil d upon pray r
and ah morrow crimson dawn may rise
To plung horror despair

yet well know dread spear wield
ala fear limb fenc d care
and valour thextend shield
may leav oft genrou bosom bare

say reverend druid bless vain
can vain extend spotless hand
will heav n listen priest complain
and save altar unhallow d band

Oh ye ll fear the sacr grove
that rear untouch d branch sky
beneath whose shade chosen servant rove
hidden weak unconsecr eye

beneath whose shade choral bard rehears
pierc uprai d eye mist shroud
and listen catch heav ndictat vers
By air etheri wail cloud

It neer hark hear sound
Of one step yet youth love
He would flown scarc touch d ground
not lingr thu weari caution move

the heavi wander approach nigh
but drear dark skreen view
Ah graciou heav n arthur sigh
which unwil breez faintli blew

Oh speak inform fear
speak reliev doubt trembl heart
To thi albina tongu sincer
A portion thi wretched impart

sweet maid repli wound die youth
In accent mourn tremul slow
ye ever answer thee truth
while yet feebl tide life shall flow

We made haughti roman chief retir
the towr sacrilegi eagl flew
our bosom swell d mortal fire
when field indign withdrew

but ill bespeak faint languid tongu
the glow beauti joy sight
ill breast keenest tortur wrung
dwell charm terror fight

To other leav envi strain
which shall age rend british air
nor thi partial ear expect vain
To find humbl name arthur

go victori warm
the reward valour obtain
soon return clad nobler form
again triumph slain

Ah dear albina ceas griev
nor thi lover gloriou fate repin
for though present favour d form leav
thi constant heart shall still thine

ala een feel ici hand
Of hasti death press swell heart
een hear sweet aerial band
summon thi faith arthur depart

let thi tear absent lover mourn
rememb brave nobli die
rememb quickli return
and claim lov d destin d bride

As thu warrior faint spirit fled
and part life stream forth everi vein
hi quiver lip whisper softli said
rememb arthur die live

Oh stay dear youth hapless maiden cri
My bestlov d arthur one moment stay
and close yet allenliven eye
So late light torch day

Ah yet look tender love
Of fond regret arthur let view
let one effort thi affect prove
and bid long adieu

now ere moon withdraw feebl light
ope yet thi fade eye
He hear memori taen flight
and vanish d last convuls sigh

whi varieg wreath prepar
To pay conqueror everi honor due
Or fillet bind flow hair
and ting arm bright azur hue

Oh must constant bosom beat
thi skil hand direct spear
must lost albina still fate deplor
and ever drop unavail tear

must love face review
express emot mind
No repeat sweetli sad adieu
No gay chaplet forehead bind

hi forehead high fair martial grace
and bold free curl glossi chesnut crown d
the full dark eyebrow adorn d face
oerwhelm foe terror frown d

hi voic though strong harmoni clear
No shall fill albina delight
No shall sooth stillattent ear
and make fanci everi sorrow light

farewel love happi joy
yet cull summer choicest bloom
funer chaplet shall time employ
and wither daili arthur tomb

As thu mourn d bitterest woe opprest
A ray light illumin d grove
and consol voic fair addrest
In soft accent parent love

though still clasp d hero valu cors
she slowli rai d languid stream eye
and d astonish resistless forc
view stranger wild surpriz

the form clad robe purest white
that swept solemn digniti ground
contrast blackest gloom night
which reign d aw majesti around

the silver beard rever demand
and told holi bard
whose shrivel d finger grasp d flame brand
which threw lustr wave hair

hi eye possess d brilliant fire youth
unit wisdom sage
and speak simpl voic truth
He blend solemn age

aris thou loveliest misfortun train
and ceas weak despond tear shed
the soft effus thi grief restrain
which serv disturb peac dead

the youth mourn far scene woe
To world neverend joy flown
where blest bosom delight shall glow
and fair templ wear princ crown

Ah presumptu question sky
nor vain lament loss deplor

the fratern duel


oh hide sun loath sight

No may sparkl glori view
No pierc lustr meet eye
On night black wing comfort flew
At breath morn sicken die

where fli In sequest d clime
doe dark ever hold ebon reign
where woeful dirg measur time
and endless echo breath sullen strain

where dreari mountain rear lowr head
To pierc heavi umbrag cloud
and cavern dewi moistur shed
and night thick veil guilti mourner shroud

there lost horror might vent sigh
To open miseri resign
might snatch tortur vision ere fli
and feast prospect desol mine

Oh let thither quickli take flight
and chuse favourit final seat
In scene would gentler mind affright
but guilt afford fit retreat

there ray gleam light could come
there could find relief
there might rumin edward doom
and lose luxuri grief

and though joy around shine
though pleasur erect dazzl brow
wrapt despond droop pine
and tear anguish shall ever flow

Oh edward couldst thou see alter d frame
which youth grace late adorn
couldst thou behold think still
thi gay friend thu hapless forlorn

the cheek late ruddi health embrown d
now pale fade incess tear
the eye elat disdain d ground
now sunk languid orb appear

Oh never never ceas griev
and sure repent pardon may obtain
can woe unfeign d incit heav n reliev
A wretch opprest agon pain

sleep meant chase away thought
To lull sound disson despair

and torn heart find refug

If moment fetter wear
and soft pressur pale eye controul
injur d emma reproach hear
Or edward form appal shrink soul

when transitori sleep lie
oft beauteou bleed form review
A mild benign lustr light eye
As come bid friend last adieu

start shudder tune voic
when sooth whisper meet ear
that sound oft made heart rejoic
alltrembl affright hear

wa thi fault dear muchlament youth
If love emma thi suit prefer
she saw thee form d tender truth
and king might glori lov d

thi nativ sweet artless heart
and well differ charact knew
whilst thi mild look happi impart
she saw murder glanc threw

yet meanli thee upbraid
and base urg d elder brother right
then call impiou passion aid
forc d thee unwil fatal fight

Oh neer shall forget dread hour
sheath d weapon thi nobl breast
thi die hand clasp d mine feebl pow r
and thi mangl bosom fondli prest

whilst oer thee speechless anguish hung
thou sawst wild distract eye
and though chill death restrain d thi tongu
thi bosom heav d sympathet sigh

with cruel tender friend contriv d
To bear drear pollut shore
Of everi joy peac depriv d

My dearest brother tenderest friend
O come save dark abyss

and bear realm bliss

Ah whenc pang smote shudder heart
where refug lost anselm fli
T death know crimson dart

It cut vast expans air
No never reach realm light
for sin weight immov lie

thu wretch anselm rav d unhappi youth
though passion hurri thee far astray
thi infant soul ador d god truth
and virtu usher d thi vernal day

Oh learn d passion restrain
and let cool reason breast presid
hi opn wisdom bloom d vain
nor ere prime manhood die

yet remors could expiat guilt
If worst suffer could crime eras
If tear could wash away blood spilt
then anselm penit obtain d grace

befor fair aurora spread
her azur mantl oer sky
while sleep pleas influenc shed
On grate mortal weari eye

On bleak mountain sullen brow
A solitari outlaw stood
and view d mist world

with deep regret bosom fraught
hi arm wreath d sorrow knot
nor seem d yet patienc taught
To bear submiss lot

hidden enliven grace
deprest untim doom
A hectic flush oerspread face
instead natur florid bloom

untutor d school grief
hi pine spirit spoke sigh
though almost hopeless relief
He look d around eager eye

and fondli bent anxiou ear
To slow murmur breez
essay oft vain hear
A friendli step beneath tree

delus wish last cri
whi wilt thou fill ach breast
and thu miseri derid
By tell might blest

No kind consol hither bend
By sympathi eas care
here come everfaith friend
who yet might shield despair

the abbey wellknown tow r seek
It fade impass d eye
the fanci outlin softli break
and melt distant sky

No piti object remain
that may know scene near
where gener love friendship reign
and alwin name may claim tear

and lov d patern grove
where must shew head
In fair walk stranger rove
and treacher norman daili tread

een presenc may prophan
the hall herbert resid
een may joy glad reign
and adelaid perci bride

yet soul seat truth
would neer second love receiv
the sacr vow artless youth
her alwin ever shall believ

they still shall comfort sad heart
and sooth anguish mind
shall still cheer hope impart
and make somewhat resign d

Ah yet hear trembl hand
withdraw bolt set free
yet hear hasti kind command
My alwin fli live

No obtain love
would thee world resign
then let thi prompt obedi prove
that thou art truli wholli mine

and ever promis true
No pleasur shall soul elat
for yet constant thought pursu
A wretch outlaw hapless fate

In vain proud ranulph shall upbraid
My adelaid still
and thi sake dear love maid
curs norman name

not though father larg domain
are plunder d murder band
and northumbria fertil plain
lie wast cruel hand

though son mourn fate
Of life owe
and hate heart thu creat
the dim severest woe

though behold friendli steel
To give emma vengeanc drawn
and though brother pang feel
To know destitut forlorn

though banish d sight day
In dreari solitud pine
and forc d feel tyrant sway
each dear patern right resign

yet seal lip dare
To extric haughti foe
the hate guilti root spare
which produc fair rose

but thou heart wilt thou calm
Oh tell reflect ceas
and fond bosom warm
Be ever tranquilliz d peac

Ah father scorn eye
Is ever present view
and tell herbert dar d die
though norman could son subdu

each feebl plea soul disdain
they fault aton
though left northumbria plain
fifteen summer known

and hear herbert swear
It fear urg d flight
A worthless life care
thought parent right

then pardon youth compli d
To eas mother anxiou fear
that rather would die
yield sister tear

ala peasant humbl shed
soon saw saint parent death
who heart anguish bled
with piou hope resign d breath

when mist foretel evn near
and cloud chill dew aris
We sought grave dear
and offer d tear sigh

till mild reflect lent aid
and bade filial sorrow ceas
the fever soul allay d
We sunk mourn peac

My pensiv bosom strove keep
A die mother last request
let thought vengeanc sleep
and studi make emma blest

No longer shun dawn
Or seek sequest d shade
call d sister lawn
and trod flowri glade

submit wayward fate
talk d treasur flown
but still seem d easi sedat
while press verdur

then wish d fear d
wa fratern love inspir d
and one everi tie endear d
the friend soul desir d

yet soon pleas calm fled
A norman beauti heart
imperi love footstep led
and bade secreci depart

d splendour race
altho peasant form bore
fanci silenc disgrac
and hid sentiment

her father tongu fate decre
and doom d great herbert son shame
for tho love prison freed
bear outlaw hate name

My sister fond friend shield
No rel allay grief
for tyranni heart hath steel d
and nought give soul relief

with evri qualiti charm
A guardian heaven allow
To screen thi artless youth harm
and fair desert help thee

No aid comfort nigh
and shall thi brother remain
ha fortitud fli
and burst heavi servil chain

whi linger alon
unseen everi human eye
To live unfriend unknown
and dreari desart die

for sunbeam gild sky
and give misti morn grace
far light m doom d fli
abandon d human race

but ll bear suspens
too dear price purchas breath
ll seek scene yet deplor
and meet welcom wishdfor death

tortur d frenzi alwin flew
and left sad retreat
He turn look d last adieu
and shook dewdrop feet

hi hurri step press d ground
nor point path came
and though long way found
despair buoy d faint frame

the sun shot forth feebl ray
but hid gloriou orb sight
and pale even modest grey
had soften d tooglar light

when alwin reach d humbl cot
that emma share
and weep hail d wellknown spot
In vain emma

repul d turn d languid eye
where ranulph lofti turret rose
and heav disappoint sigh
He sought mansion foe

hi falter step came
A proud disdain air possest
memori recal d former shame
and indign fill d breast

He enter d wild attir
with hasti pace haggard brow
scorn fill d azur eye fire
and gave cheek deeper glow

A grace knight met view
sat plead ladi side
and alwin jealou bosom knew

mistaken youth thi eye seen

but pensiv mien
and forehead hand reclin d

oer lord ranulph fondli bend
with sorrow seat brow
while regret tear descend

Ah thu sad alwin said

lord perci rai d droop head
and love emma met view

then raptur surpriz prevail d

while return mourner hail d

O dearest alwin

In adelaid behold thi bride

with step convul d unsettl eye

A heart ungener cold

Ah poison bale pow r

An age monarch dethron
and hear unmov d father groan

No murder thought soul employ
