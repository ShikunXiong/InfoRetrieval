If write journal task
from cottag king
A littl book d ask
and fill full wing

each pair repres day
On sun rise
while other bent mourn way
through cold cloudi sky

and would lightn bring
with threaten fork glare
and hallow rainbow fling
across troubl air

some faint wearili glide
their broken flight along
while high air ride
dilat bold strong

some agit adrift
against rove
some steer forward sure swift
should scarc seem move

while other happiest kind
should ether soar
As care would ever find
No sorrow reach

when soon arrow

and mani crimson drop flow
befor fell sight

the rapid abrupt descent

luci think thi beauti
prais peculiar grace
To see thee path duti
and happi smile face
convey pleasur thi friend
than outward charm could lend

see thi grace babe caress thee
mark thi wise matern care
and sadli word impress
the magic word thou art fair
wonder tongu found
To utter unfeel sound

for art thou prais
and see
poor joy flatteri rais
and oh much unworthi thee
unworthi one whose heart feel
the voic truth warmth zeal

O luci thou art snatch d folli
becom tender vain
the world make melancholi
the world would lure thee back
and would cost mani sigh
To see win bright prize

though pass apprehens move
know thou hast nobl heart
but luci truli love thee
So much admir thee thou art
that shadow fear
wake breast pang sincer

Or plant tendril fine

dare bid thee stay

the heart may shrink spirit fail
but spaniard must free
and pride duti shall prevail
oer love thee

then go round gallant head

and mani tender prayer

should freedom perish thi death
twere folli repin

To hold humour half hour

If anxiou friend declar d

A heart thu pierc d would never rove

No distanc eer could give pain
No rivalri torment brain

Of rule establish d place
Or enter grace

but thought such nonsens better spard
and went undaunt alon
To place throne

nor measur d step one two three
but made careless slouch bow

We everi look action sway
and prompt delight obey
for height size like thing
We care far less king
but station learn pretenc

the warrior must look big
the lawyer doff fork wig
the portli merchant rich free
forget pride bend knee
the doctor give terror scope
and like patient whine hope
In short wise childish fit
and fool madmen find wit
then go silli pride subdu
and thou shall servant
