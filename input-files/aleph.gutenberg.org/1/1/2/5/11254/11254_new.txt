A poem IN imit OF the third satir OF juven

qui inepta
tam patien urbi tam ferreu ut teneat se

juven

though grief fond breast rebel
when injur thale bid town farewel
yet still calmer thought choic commend
prais hermit regret friend
resolv length vice london far
To breath distant field purer air
and fix d cambria solitari shore
give St david one true briton

for would leav unbrib hibernia land
Or chang rock scotland strand
there none swept sudden fate away
but hunger spare age decay
here malic rapin accid conspir
and rabbl rage fire
their ambush relentless ruffian lay
and fell attorney prowl prey
here fall hous thunder head
and femal atheist talk dead

while thale wait wherri contain
Of dissip wealth small remain
On thame bank silent thought stood
where greenwich smile upon silver flood
struck seat gave eliza birth
We kneel kiss consecr earth
In pleas dream bliss age renew
and call britannia glori back view
behold cross triumphant main
the guard commerc dread spain
ere masquerad debauch d excis oppress d
Or english honour grew stand jest

A transient calm happi scene bestow
and moment lull sens woe
At length awak contemptu frown
indign thale eye neighbour town
sinc worth cri degener day
want een cheap reward empti prais
In curs wall devot vice gain
sinc unreward scienc toil vain
sinc hope sooth doubl distress
and everi moment leav littl less
while yet steadi step staff sustain
and life still vigor revel vein
grant kind heaven find happier place
where honesti sens disgrac
some pleas bank verdant osier play
some peac vale natur paint gay
where harass d briton found repos
and safe poverti defi foe
some secret cell ye power indulg give
let live learn d live
here let reign pension incit
To vote patriot black courtier white
explain countri dearbought right away
and plead pirat face day
with slavish tenet taint poison d youth
and lend lie confid truth
let rais palac manor buy
collect tax farm lotteri
with warbl eunuch fill silenc stage
and lull servitud thoughtless age
hero proceed bound pride shall hold
what check restrain thirst power gold
behold rebelli virtu quit oerthrown
behold fame wealth live

To plunder land given
when public crime inflam wrath heaven
but friend hope remain
who start theft blush perjuri
who scarc forbear though britain court sing
To pluck titl poet borrow d wing
A statesman logic unconvinc hear
and dare slumber oer gazett
despis fool half pension dress d
and strive vain laugh clodio jest

other softer smile subtler art
can sap principl taint heart
with address lover note convey
Or bribe virgin innoc away
well may rise whose rustic tongu
neer knew puzzl right varnish wrong
spurn d beggar dread spi
live unregard unlament die

for social guilt friend endear
who share orgilio crime fortun share
but thou tempt villani present
all marlborough hoard villier spent
turn glitter bribe thi scorn eye
nor sell gold gold could never buy
the peac slumber selfapprov day
unsulli fame conscienc ever gay

the cheat nation happi favourit see
mark great caress frown
london needi villain gener home
the commonsew pari rome
with eager thirst folli fate
suck dreg corrupt state
forgiv transport theme like
bear french metropoli

illustri edward realm day
the land hero saint survey
nor hope british lineament trace
the rustic grandeur surli grace
but lost thoughtless eas empti show
behold warrior dwindl beau
sens freedom pieti refin d away
Of franc mimic spain prey

all home beg steal
Or like gibbet better wheel
hiss d stage hoot court
their air dress polit import
obsequi art volubl gay
On britain fond credul prey
No gain trade industri scape
they sing danc clean shoe cure clap
all scienc fast monsieur know
and bid go hell hell goe
Ah avail slaveri far
drew breath life english air
wa earli taught briton right prize
and lisp tale henri victori
If gull d conqueror receiv chain
and flatteri prevail arm vain

studiou pleas readi submit
the suppl gaul born parasit
still interest true where goe
wit braveri worth lavish tongu bestow
In everi face thousand grace shine
from everi tongu flow harmoni divin
these art vain rug nativ tri
strain falter diffid lie
and get kick awkward flatteri

besid justic discern age

well may ventur mimic art
who play morn night borrow d part
practis master notion embrac
repeat maxim reflect face
with everi wild absurd compli
and view object anoth eye
To shake laughter ere jest hear
To pour counterfeit tear
and patron hint cold heat
To shake dogday decemb sweat

how competitor like contend
can surli virtu hope fix friend
slave seriou impud beguil
and lie without blush without smile
exalt trifl everi vice ador
your tast snuff judgment whore
can balbo eloqu applaud swear
He grope breech monarch air

for art like preferr d admir caress d
they first invad tabl breast

watch weak hour ransack heart
then soon illplac confid repay

By number shame censur free
all crime safe hate poverti

thi provok snarl muse
the sober trader tatter d cloak
wake dream labour joke
with brisker air silken courtier gaze
and turn variou taunt thousand way
Of grief harass distress d
sure bitter scorn jest
fate never wound deep gener heart
than blockhead insult point dart

ha heaven reserv piti poor
No pathless wast undiscov d shore
No secret island boundless main
No peac desert yet unclaim d spain
quick let us rise happi seat explor
and bear oppress insol

slow rise worth BY poverti depress D

As sad thought impend fate
when proud grecian dame shall task impos

beneath hyperia water shall sweat
and faint scarc support liquid weight
then shall argiv loud insult cri
behold wife hector guard troy
tear name shall drown beauteou eye
and fair bosom heav rise sigh

Ye nightingal ye twist pine
Ye swain haunt grove
Ye gentl echo breezi wind
Ye close retreat lore

with natur art

Oh teach young unpractis heart
To make nanci mine

A fairi tale

IN the ancient english style

In britain isl arthur day
when midnight faeri danc maze
live edwin green
edwin wi gentl youth
endow d courag sens truth
though badli shape

hi mountain back mote well said
To measur heighth head
and lift
yet spite natur
To make uncouth form forbid
thi creatur dare love

He felt charm edith eye
nor want hope gain prize
could ladi look within
but one sir topaz dress d art
and shape could win heart
He shape win

edwin right read song
with slight passion pace along
all mooni light
T near old enchant court
where sportiv faeri made resort
To revel night

hi heart drear hope cross d
T late t farr path lost
that reach d neighbourtown
with weari step quit shade
resolv darkl dome tread
and drop limb adown

but scant lay floor
when hollow wind remov door
A trembl rock ground
and well ween count aright
At hundr taper light
On wall around

now sound tongu assail ear
now sound feet approachen near
and sound increas
and corner lay
He see train profus gay
come prankl oer place

but trust gentl never yet
wa dight masqu half neat
Or half rich
the countri lent sweet perfum
the sea pearl sky plume

now whilst gaze gallant dress d
In flaunt robe rest
with aw accent cri
what mortal wretch mind

At swain whose ventur soul
No fear magic art control

We faeri never injur men
who dare tell us true

Be mine task eer part
To make thee grief resign
now take pleasur thi chaunc
whilst mab partner daunc
Be littl mabl thine

He spoke asudden
light music float wanton air
the monarch lead queen
the rest faeri partner found
and mabl trimli tripp d ground
with edwin green

the daunc past board laid
and siker feast made
As heart lip desir
withouten hand dish fli
the glass wish come nigh
and wish retir

but pleas faeri king
full everi deal laugh sing
and antic feat devis
some wind tumbl like ape
and transmut shape
In edwin wonder eye

till one last robin bight
renown d pinch maid night
ha hent aloof
and full beam flung
where back youth hung
To spraul unneath roof

from thenc revers charm cri
and let fairli suffic
the gambol shown
but oberon answer smile
content thee edwin
the vantag thine

here end phantomplay
they smelt fresh approach day
and heard cock crow
the whirl wind bore crowd
ha clapp d door whistl loud
To warn go

then scream fli
and taper die
poor edwin fall floor
forlorn state dark place
wa never wight sike case

but soon dan apollo rose
full jolli creatur home goe
He feel back less
hi honest tongu steadi mind
had rid lump behind
which made want success

with lusti livelyh talk
He seem adaunc walk
hi stori soon took wind
and beauteou edith see youth
endow d courag sens truth
without bunch behind

the stori told sir topaz move
the youth edith erst approv
To see revel scene
At close eve leav home
and wend find ruin d dome
all gloomi plain

As bide befel
the wind came rustl dell
A shake seiz wall
Up spring taper
the faeri bragli foot floor
and music fill hall

but cert sore sunk woe
sir topaz see elfin show
hi spirit die
when oberon cri A man near
A mortal passion cleep fear

with sir topaz hapless youth
In accent falter aye ruth

for al mister wight

To tread circl haunt

Ah losel vile roar
and littl skill d faeri lore
thi caus come know
now thi kestrel courag fell
and faeri sinc lie tell
are free work thee woe

then will bear wispi fire
To trail swain among mire
the caitiff upward flung
there like tortois shop
He dangl chambertop
where whilom edwin hung

the revel proce apac
deftli frisk oer place
they sit drink eat
the time frolic mirth beguil
and poor sir topaz hang
till rout retreat

By star began wink
they shriek fli taper sink
and ydrop knight
for never spell faeri laid
with strong enchant bound glade
beyond length night

chill dark alon adre lay
till welkin rose day
then deem d dole oer
but wot ye well harder lot
hi seeli back bunch got
which edwin lost afor

thi tale sybilnurs aread

and tale done

with base impedi rise
and born none

but virtu advaunc
To favourit fool chaunc
By fortun seem d design d
virtu gain odd fate
and shake weight
upon unworthi mind

A thought long spare
our race mortal call care

what name god call d

and love work though one bought

In jove etern sabl head
contriv shape empow d breath
and worldl beneath

He grave show d forward face
jove talk d breed high
An undersometh sky

but eer gave mighti nod
which ever bind poet god
for curl ambrosi shake
and mother earth oblig quak
He saw old mother earth aris
she stood confess d eye
but read wore
A castl crown
nor long street longer road

As yet wreath alon dress d
and trail d landscapepaint vest
then thrice rais ovid said
and thrice bow d weighti head

nay rather ask monarch said
what boot hand heart head

halv halv cri honest care
your plea would make titl fair
you claim bodi soul
but join d claim whole

thu god debat began
On trivial caus man
and celesti temper rage
quoth virgil later age

As thu wrangl time came
there none paint
for fabl ancient sung
make saturn old time young
As yet winter shed
their silver honour head
He got pinion free
from old sire etern
A serpent girdl round wore
the tail within mouth
By almanac clear
that learn egypt meant year
A staff carri high
A glass fix d measur
As amber box made show
for head cane age ago
hi vest day night pie
A bend sickl arm d side
and spring new month train adorn

they make umpir caus
oer low trunk arm laid
where sinc hour dial made
then lean heard nice debat
and thu pronounc word fate

To care join d man due

He said sprung swift career
To trace circl year
where ever sinc season wheel
and tread one anoth heel

T well said jove consent
thunder shook firmament
our umpir time shall way
with care let creatur stay
let busi vex avaric blind
let doubt knowledg rack mind
let error act opinion speak
and want afflict sick break
and anger burn deject chill
and joy distract sorrow kill
till arm d care taught mow

and wast man whose quick decay

AN imit OF some french vers

To work new decay

and ruin man nice machin

On newlyborn desir

My youth met fortun fair array d
In pomp shone
and might perhap well essay d
To make gift

On unworthi mind

My manhood felt vigor fire
By love increas
but year come year conspir
To break chain wore
In weak safe sex see

My troubl laid rest
and truth would disturb peac

In sad reflect fli
Ye fondl passion soul
Ye sweet deceit aris

To thing use pleas
In pain philosophi spleen
In health t eas




A nightpiec ON death

By blue taper trembl light
No wast wake night
intent endless view pore
the schoolmen sage oer
their book wisdom wide stray
Or point best longest way
ll seek readier path go
where wisdom sure taught

how deep yon azur dye sky
where orb gold unnumb d lie
while rank silver pride
the nether crescent seem glide
the slumber breez forget breath
the lake smooth clear beneath
where spangl show
descend meet eye
the ground right aspir
In dim view retir
the left present place grave
whose wall silent water lave
that steepl guid thi doubt sight
among livid gleam night
there pass melancholi state
By solemn heap fate
and think softlysad tread
abov vener dead
time like thee life possess d
and time shall thou shalt rest

those grave bend osier bound
that nameless heav crumbl ground
quick glanc thought disclos
where toil poverti repos

the flat smooth stone bear name
the chisel slender help fame
which eer set friend decay
their frequent step may wear away
A middl race mortal
men halfambiti unknown

the marbl tomb rise high
whose dead vault arch lie
whose pillar swell sculptur stone
arm angel epitaph bone
these poor remain state
adorn rich prais great
who earth fame live
are senseless fame give

Ha gaze pale cynthia fade
the burst earth unveil shade
all slow wan wrapp d shroud
they rise visionari crowd
and sober accent cri
think mortal die

now yon black funer yew
that bath charnalhous dew
methink hear voic begin
Ye raven ceas croak din
Ye toll clock time resound
oer long lake midnight ground
It send peal hollow groan
thu speak among bone

when men scyth dart suppli
how great king fear
they view like last thing
they make dread sting
fool less provok fear
No spectreform appear
death path must trod
If man would ever pass god
A port calm state eas
from rough rage swell sea

whi thi flow sabl stole
deep pendent cypress mourn pole
loos scarf fall athwart thi weed
long pall drawn hears cover d steed
and plume black tread
nod oer scutcheon dead

nor part bodi know
nor want soul form woe
As men long prison dwell
with lamp glimmer round cell
whene suffer year run
spring forth greet glitter sun
such joy though far transcend sens
have piou soul part henc
On earth bodi place
A evil year wast
but chain cast asid
see glad scene unfold wide
clap glad wing tower away
and mingl blaze day




A hymn TO content

To gain thi love perceiv

and seek vainli done

No real happi found
In trail purpl oer ground
Or soul exalt high
To rang circuit sky

and doubt last knowledg rise

love last peac appear

Is eden bless d

T thu shade stood

It seem d quiet place

while silver water glide along
To pleas ear court song

but want ask tongu man

Go search among idl dream

and find life equal bliss
Or next begun

hath bleach d tyrant cheek everi vari clime
what time ironheart gaul
with frantic superstit guid

the ruthless hag weser flood
In heaven name urg infern blow
and red stream began flow

antistroph

the saxon princ horror fled
from altar stain d human gore
and liberti rout legion led
In safeti bleak norwegian shore
there cave asleep lay
lull d hoars resound main
when bold savag pass d way
impel d destini name disdain

Of ampl front portli chief appear d
the hunt bear suppli shaggi vest
the drift snow hung yellow beard
and broad shoulder brave furiou blast
He stopp d gaze bosom glow d
and deepli felt impress charm
He seiz advantag fate allow d
and straight compress d vigor arm

stroph

the curlew scream d triton blew
their shell celebr ravish d rite
old time exult flew
and independ saw light
the light saw albion happi plain
where cover flower thorn
while philomel renew d warbl strain
the auspici fruit stolen embrac born
the mountain dyriad seiz joy
the smile infant charg consign d
the doric muse caress d favourit boy
the hermit wisdom store open mind
As roll year matur age
He flourish d bold sinewi sire
while mild passion breast assuag
the fiercer flame matern fire

antistroph

and zealou rove pole pole

and warm patriot thought aspir soul
On desert isl t rais

where tyranni beheld amaz
fair freedom templ mark d grave
He steel d blunt batavian arm
To burst iberian doubl chain
and citi rear d plant farm
won skirt neptun wide domain
He gener rustic sate
On uri rock close divan
and wing d arrow sure fate
which ascertain d sacr right man

To freedom adamantin shrine
and mani tartar hord forlorn aghast
He snatch d fell oppress wing
and taught amidst dreari wast
the allcheer hymn liberti sing
He virtu find like preciou ore

een stand calvi rocki shore
and turn dross corsica gold
He guardian geniu taught youth

where varnish d vice vaniti combin
To dazzl seduc banner spread
and forg vile shackl freeborn mind
while insol wrinkl front uprear

and titl illwoven chaplet wear
full often wreath d around miscreant brow
where everdimpl falsehood pert vain

while fond raptur amaz
On thi transcend charm gaze
My cautiou soul essay vain
her peac freedom maintain
yet let bloom form divin
where grace harmoni combin
those eye like genial orb move
dispens glad joy love
In pomp assail view
intent bosom subdu
My breast wari maxim steel d
not charm shall forc yield

but invok beauti aid
see enlighten d soul display d
that soul sensibl sedat
amid storm froward fate
thi geniu activ strong clear
thi wit sublim though sever
the social ardour void art
that glow within thi candid heart
My spirit sens strength decay
My resolut die away
and everi faculti oppress d
almighti love invad breast




song

To fix twere task vain
To count april drop rain
To sow afric barren soil
Or tempest hold within toil

know friend light air
fals fowler art snare
inconst pass wind
As winter dreari frost unkind

though hundr gallant await
from victori eye fate

blush inglori reign
sometim strive break chain
My reason summon aid

Ah friend t shortliv tranc
dispel d one enchant glanc
she need look confess
those look complet curs bless

So soft eleg fair
sure someth human
must submit strife vain
T destini forg chain



song

let nymph still avoid deaf swain
who transport passion affect complain
for rage love frenzi shown
and blast blow loudest soon overblown

but shepherd cupid pierc heart
will submiss ador rejoic smart
Or plaintiv soft murmur bosomfelt woe
like smoothglid current river flow

though silent tongu plead eye
and heart sway tribut sigh
but accost meadow grove
hi tale tender raptur love



song

from man love though heart disguis
freeli describ wretch despis
and sens balanc straw
He sure take hint pictur draw

A wit without sens without fanci beau
like parrot chatter strut like crow
A peacock pride grimac baboon
In courag hind conceit gascon

As vultur rapaci falsehood fox
inconst wave unfeel rock
As tiger feroci pervers hog
In mischief ape fawn dog

In word sum talent togeth
hi heart lead brain feather
yet sens balanc straw
He sure take hint pictur draw



song

come listen ye student everi degre

A statesman profound critic immens
In short mere jumbl learn sens
and yet talent though laudabl vain
hi famili art could never attain

hi father intend fortun build
In youth would taught trowel wield
but mortar disciplin never would stick
for skull secur face brick
and endeavour patienc pain
the skill sire could never attain

hi mother housewif neat art wise
renown d delic biscuit pie
soon alter d studi flatter tast
from rais wall rear past
but instruct fruitless vain
the pyemak mysteri could neer attain

yet true race labour seen
A jumbl profess ween
for geniu ventur trust
hi pie seem d brick hous crust
then good Mr tutor pray vain
sinc famili art could never attain
