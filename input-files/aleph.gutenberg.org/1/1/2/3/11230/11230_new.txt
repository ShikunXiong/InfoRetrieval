A ballad


turn gentl hermit dale
and guid lone way
To yon taper cheer vale
with hospit ray

for forlorn lost tread
with faint step slow
where wild immeasur spread
seem lengthen go

forbear son hermit cri
To tempt danger gloom
for yonder faithless phantom fli
To lure thee thi doom

here houseless child want
My door open still
and though portion scant
give good

then turn tonight freeli share
whate cell bestow
My rushi couch frugal fare
My bless repos

No flock rang valley free
To slaughter condemn
taught power piti
learn piti

but mountain grassi side
A guiltless feast bring
A scrip herb fruit suppli
and water spring

then pilgrim turn thi care forego
all earthborn care wrong
man want littl
nor want littl long

soft dew heaven descend
hi gentl accent fell
the modest stranger lowli bend
and follow cell

far wilder obscur
the lone mansion lay
A refug neighbour poor
and stranger led astray

No store beneath humbl thatch
requir master care
the wicket open latch
receiv harmless pair

and busi crowd retir
To take even rest
the hermit trimm d littl fire
and cheer d pensiv guest

and spread veget store
and gaili press smile
and skill d legendari lore
the linger hour beguil

around sympathet mirth
it trick kitten tri
the cricket chirrup hearth
the crackl faggot fli

but noth could charm impart
To sooth stranger woe
for grief heavi heart
and tear began flow

hi rise care hermit spi
with answer care oppress d
and whenc unhappi youth cri
the sorrow thi breast

from better habit spurn d
reluct dost thou rove
Or griev friendship unreturn d
Or unregard love

ala joy fortun bring
are trifl decay
and prize paltri thing
more trifl still

and friendship name
A charm lull sleep
A shade follow wealth fame
but leav wretch weep

and love still emptier sound
the modern fair one jest
On earth unseen found
To warm turtl nest

for shame fond youth thi sorrow hush
and spurn sex said
but spoke rise blush
hi lovelorn guest betray d

surpris see new beauti rise
swift mantl view
like colour oer morn sky
As bright transient

the bash look rise breast
altern spread alarm
the love stranger stand confess d
A maid charm

and Ah forgiv stranger rude
A wretch forlorn cri
whose feet unhallow d thu intrud
where heaven resid

but let maid thi piti share
whom love taught stray
who seek rest find despair
companion way

My father live besid tyne
A wealthi lord
and wealth mark d mine
He

To win tender arm
unnumb d suitor came
who prais imput charm
and felt feign d flame

each hour mercenari crowd
with richest proffer strove
amongst rest young edwin bow d
but never talk d love

In humbl simpl habit clad
No wealth power
wisdom worth
but

and besid dale
He carol d lay love
hi breath lent fragranc gale
and music grove

the blossom open day
the dew heaven refin
could nought puriti display
To emul mind

the dew blossom tree
with charm inconst shine
their charm woe
their constanc mine

for still tri fickl art
importun vain
and passion touch d heart
triumph d pain

till quit deject scorn
He left pride
and sought solitud forlorn
In secret die

but mine sorrow mine fault
and well life shall pay
ll seek solitud sought
and stretch lay

and forlorn despair hid
ll lay die
T edwin
and

forbid heaven hermit cri
and clasp d breast
the wonder fair one turn d chide
T edwin self press d

turn angelina ever dear
My charmer turn see
thi thi longlost edwin
restor love thee

thu let hold thee heart
and everi care resign
and shall never never part
My life mine

No never hour part
We ll live love true
the sigh rend thi constant heart
shall break thi edwin

Of differ theme veer song mix

and well mountain might repli
To sire yore

To spoil spoiler may

A tartar ukrain breed
who look d though speed thought
were limb wild
wild wild deer untaught
with spur bridl undefil
T day caught
and snort erect mane
and struggl fierc vain
In full foam wrath dread
To desertborn led
they bound menial throng
upon back mani thong
then loos sudden lash
away away dash
torrent less rapid less rash



away away steed
upon pinion wind
all human dwell left behind
We sped like meteor sky
when crackl sound night
Is chequer d northern light
town villag none track
but wild plain far extent
and bound forest black
and save scarc seen battlement
On distant height stronghold
against tartar built old
No trace man the year
A turkish armi march d oer
and spahi hoof hath trod
the verdur fli bloodi sod
the sky dull dim gray
and low breez crept moan
could answer sigh
but fast fled away away
and could neither sigh pray
and cold sweatdrop fell like rain
upon courser bristl mane
but snort still rage fear
He flew upon far career
At time almost thought inde
He must slacken d speed
but bound slender frame

which stand thereon like stiffen d gore
upon slain battl oer
and long winter night hath shed

So cold stark raven beak
may peck unpierc frozen cheek
T wild wast underwood
and chestnut stood
the strong oak hardi pine
but far apart well
Or els differ lot mine
the bough gave way tear
My limb found strength bear
My wound alreadi scarr d cold
My bond forbad loos hold
We rustl leav like wind
left shrub tree wolv behind
By night heard track

with long gallop tire

At daybreak wind wood

when stirr d beyond calmer mood
and trodden hard upon like

and throb throb till grown pang

My blood reflow d though thick chill
My ear uncouth nois rang
My heart began thrill

the wild hors swim wilder stream
the bright broad river gush tide

and halfway struggl oer
To yon unknown silent shore
the water broke hollow tranc
and temporari strength
My stiffen d limb rebapt
My courser broad breast proudli brave
and dash ascend wave
We reach slipperi shore length
A littl prize
for behind dark drear
and night fear
how mani hour night day
In suspend pang lay

If human breath drew

with glossi skin drip mane
and reel limb reek flank
the wild steed sinewi nerv still strain
Up repel bank
We gain top boundless plain
spread shadow night
and onward onward onward seem
like precipic dream
To stretch beyond sight

Or scatter d spot duski green
In mass broke light
As rose moon upon right
but nought distinctli seen
In dim wast would indic

No twinkl taper afar

To make merri woe

No sign travel none toil

and water murmur
with concert keep

and let strang mysteri dream
wave wing airi stream
Of live portraitur display
softli eyelid laid
and wake sweet music breath
abov underneath
sent spirit mortal good
Or unseen geniu wood
but let due feet never fail
To walk studiou cloister pale
and love high embow roof
with antiqu pillar massi proof
and stori window richli dight
cast dim religi light
there let peal organ blow
To fullvoic quir
In servic high anthem clear
As may sweet mine ear

and bring heaven mine eye
and may last weari age

Of everi star heaven doth show
