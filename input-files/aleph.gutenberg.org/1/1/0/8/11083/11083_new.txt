OF the sower

behold sower go forth
To scatter oer field
the seed harvest time
A rich return yield

and sow d preciou seed
were waysid thrown
the fowl heaven descri
and soon seed gone

and seed fell hand
On stoni place round
and forthwith sprung
they depth ground

but sun came warm
sent forth beam ray
becaus root earth
they wither d away

among thorn other fell
Of hope
the seed choke droop d die
soon thorn came

but other fell good ground
and yield re told
some thirti sixti
and hundr fold

the seed waysid fell
Is wisdom heart
Of heareth word truth
but understandeth

and stoni place
Is one hear word
anon joy receiveth
and follow good

but tribul soon assail
and persecut rise
He forget word truth
and good die

the thorni place one hear
and truth receiv
but find care life wealth
hi mind heart deceiv

the good fertil ground
who hear understand
and show life obedi
all truth command
