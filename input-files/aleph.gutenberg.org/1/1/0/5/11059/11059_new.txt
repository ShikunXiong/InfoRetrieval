the sylph season



long fate hear
the slave mammon sneer
My indol reprov
Ah littl know care
the toil hardship bear
while loll elbowchair
and seem scarc move

for mount poet steed
there ceaseless journey speed
oer mountain wood stream
and oft within littl day
mid comet fierc t mine stray
and wander oer milkyway
To catch poet dream

but would man lucr know
what rich labour flow
A dream repli
and wealth ever pin d
that world within mind
where everi treasur may find
and joy never die

one night task diurnal done
for travel d sun
oer burn sand oer snow
fatigu sought couch rest
My wont pray r heaven address d
but scarc pillow press d
when thu vision rose

methought within desert cave
cold dark solemn grave
suddenli awok
It seem d sabl night cell
where save ceil fell
An ooz drop silent spell
No sound ever broke

there motionless stood alon
like strang monument stone
upon barren wild
Or like solid profound
the dark seem d wall d round
A man buri ground
where pyramid pil d

thu fix d dread hour past
and heard blast
A voic pronounc name
nor long upon ear dwelt
when round gan air melt
and motion felt
quick circl oer frame

again call d ray
that seem d gush fount day
across cavern stream d
half struck terror delight
hail d littl bless light
and follow d till ach sight
An orb dark seem d

nor long felt blind pain
for soon upon mountain plain
gaz d wonder new
there high castl rear d head
and far region spread
where everi season seem d shed
it peculiar hue

now castl massi gate
like one blindli urg fate
A buglehorn blew
the mountainplain shook around
the vale return d hollow sound
and move sigh profound
the portal open flew

then entr glitter hall
heard voic seraph call
that bade ever reign
all hail said accent wild
for thou art natur chosen child
whom wealth blood eer defil d
hail lord domain

and pace bright saloon
that seem d illumin d moon
So mellow light
the wall jetti dark teem d
while chrystal column stream
and mountain torrent seem d
highflash night

rear d midst doubl throne
like burnish d cloud even shone
while group d base around
four damsel stood faeri race
who turn heavenli grace
upon immort face
transfix d ground

and thus foremost tram
Be thine throne thine reign
oer vari year
but ere thou rulest fate command
that chosen rival band
A sylph shall win thi heart hand
thi sovereignti share

for sister birth
Do rule turn subject earth
To serv ungrat man
but sinc vari toil impart
No joy caprici heart
T ordain d human art
shall rectifi plan

then spake sylph spring seren
T i thi joyou heart ween
with sympathi shall move
for live melodi
Of bird choral symphoni
first wak d thi soul poesi
To pieti love

when thou call vernal breez
and beckn bough bud tree
hast left thi sullen fire
and stretch d thee mossi dell
and heard brows wether bell
blyth echo rous cell
To swell tinkl quir

Or heard branch flowr thorn
the song friendli cuckoo warn
the tardymov swain
hast bid purpl swallow hail
and seen ether sail
now sweep downward oer vale
and skim plain

then catch sudden glanc
the bright silverclear expans
Of broad river stream
beheld boat adown glide
and motion wind tide
where chain d ice winter pride
late roll d heavi team

Or lur d freshscent gale
that woo d moor fisher sail
To tempt mighti main
hast watch d dim reced shore
now faintli seen ocean oer
like hang cloud
To bound sapphir plain

then wrapt night scud bark
that seem d selfpoi d amid dark
through upper air leap
beheld thi fear height
beneath dolphin azur light
cleav like live meteor bright
the dark deep

T mine warm awakn hand
that made thi grate heart expand
and feel high control
Of him mighti power move
amid water grove
and vast creation prove
hi omnipres soul

Or brood oer forest rill
fring d earli daffodil
and quivr maidenhair
when thou hast mark d duski bed
with leav waterrust oerspread
that seem d amber light shed
On shadow d

and thenc murmur call d
the current trace brawl d
beneath noontid ray
and beheld checquer d shade
Of wave mani sinuou braid
that oer sunni channel play d
with motion ever gay

T magick gave
that made thi heart will slave
To gentl natur bend
and taught thee tree flower
and whisper gale drop shower
In convers sweet pass hour
As earli friend

that mid noontid sunni haze
did thi languid bosom rais
the raptur boy
when wak d second birth
thi soul everi pore look d forth
and gaz d upon beauteou earth
with myriad eye joy

that made thi heart like hi
To flow univers love
for everi live thing
and oh ray divin
thu temper thi soul refin
then let thi gentl heart mine
and bless sylph spring

and next sylph summer fair
the crisp golden hair
half veil d sunni eye
nor less may i thi homag claim
At touch whose exhal flame
the fog spring chill d thi frame
In genial vapour fli

oft heat noon opprest
with flow hair open vest
thi footstep
To mossi couch well grot
where thou hast bless d thi happi lot
that thou delici spot
mayst see feel sun

thenc trace bodi chang
In curiou philosoph rang
the motion mind
and thought thought flew
still hope vision new
the faeri land bliss view
but neer land find

and grew thi languid mood
To embowr silent wood
led thi careless way
where high tree tree air
thou sawst spider swing snare
So bright entangl
the sun left ray

Or lur d thee beetl steep
To mark deep quiet sleep
that wrapt tarn
and mountain blue forest green
invert plane seren
dim gleam filmi sheen
that glaz d paint show

perchanc mark fisher skiff
swift beneath shadowi cliff
dart like gust wind
and skimm d sunni lake
In mani play wreath wake
fartrail like silveri snake
with sinuou length behind

nor less hill dale heath
still even wrapt mimic death
thi spirit true prov d
around thee dark stole
befor thi wild creativ soul
bade faeri vision roll
thine infanc lov d

then oer silent sleep land
thi fanci like magick wand
forth caird elfin race
and around fountain brim
In circl danc gaili skim
and upon surfac swim
and waterspid chase

each circumst sight sound
peopl vacant air around
with visionari life
for amid thicket stirr d
Or flit bat wake bird
then straight thi eager fanci heard
the din faeri strife

now pass beetl hum
the elfin armi goblin drum
To pigmi battl sound
and drip dewdrop plash
On wave grass buckler clash
and quiver lanc flash
wided death around

Or moon effulg form
the pass cloud sudden storm
In quick success veil
vast serpent shadow glide
and cours mountain side
A band giant huge stride
oer hill wood dale

and still mani servic rare
could descant need
My firmer claim bind
but rest high pretenc
On genial influenc
which made bodi indol
the vigour mind

and accent deep low
like voic fondlycherish d woe
the sylph autumn sad
though may raptur sing
that grac d gentl song spring
like summer play pleasur bring
thi youth heart glad

yet still may hope aspir
thi heart touch chaster fire
and purifi love
for vision high holi
and spell quickn melancholi
thi soul sublunari folli
first rai d world

what though mine treasur fair
Of purpl grape yellow pear
and fruit variou hue
and harvest rich golden grain
that danc wave along plain
To merri song reap swain
beneath welkin blue

with may urg suit
Of summer patient toil fruit
for mortal purpos given
nor may fit sober mood
To sing sweetli murmur flood
Or die manycolour d wood
that mock bow heaven

but know t mine secret power
that wak d thee midnight hour
In bleak novemb reign
T spell around thee cast
when thou didst hear hollow blast
In murmur tell pleasur past
that neer would come

and led thee storm oer
To hear sullen ocean roar
By dread calm opprest
which still though breez
it mountainbillow heav d air
As live thing
that strove vain rest

T thou subdu woe
didst watch leav descend slow
To moral gave
and mov d mourn train
with rustl sound along plain
taught sing seraph strain
Of peac within grave

and uprai d thi stream eye
met thee western sky
In pomp even cloud
that vari form roll d
some wizard castl seem d gold
and crimson d knight old
Or king purpl proud

and last sunk set sun
and even shadow dun
the gorgeou pageant past
T life mimic shew
Of human grandeur
which thu beneath fatal blow
Of death must fall last

Oh aspir gaze
didst thou thi tranc vision rais
To yonder orb high
and think wondrou sublim
twere upward sphere climb
and live beyond reach time
child etern

and last sylph winter spake
the pierc voic shake
the castlevault
Oh youth thou soul refin d
hast felt triumph pure mind
and learnt secret joy find
In deepest scene woe

If eer fear ear eve
hast heard wail tempest griev
through chink shatter d wall
the conjur d oer thi brain
Of wander ghost mourn train
that low fit sob complain
Of death untim call

Or feel storm increa d
the love terror nerv thi breast
didst ventur coast
To see mighti warship leap
from wave wave upon deep
like chamois goat steep steep
till low valley lost

then glanc angri sky
behold cloud furi fli
the lurid moon athwart
like armi huge battl throng
and pour volli rank along
while pipe wind martial song
To rush war exhort

Oh thi heart given
To ordain d him heaven
thi nobler power wake
and oh thou poet soul
high brood oer frozen pole
hast felt beneath stern control
the desert region quak

Or old hecla cloudi height
when oer dismal halfyear night
He pour sulphrou breath
hast known petrifi wind
wild ocean curl billow bind
like bend sheav harvest hind
erect icydeath

Or heard adown mountain steep
the northern blast furiou sweep
some cliff dissev d dash
and seen spring dread bound
from rock rock gulph profound
while echo fierc cave resound
the neverend crash

If thu terror mighti spell
thi soul inspir d wont swell
thi heav frame expand
Oh thi heart inclin
for know wondrou charm mine
that fear joy thu combin
In magick union bland

nor think confin d nativ sphere
To horror gaunt ghastli fear
Or desol wild
for pleasur fair could sing
that steal life sharpest sting
and man made around cling
like mother child

when thou beneath clear blue sky
So calm cloud seen fli
hast gaz d snowi plain
where natur slept pure sweet
she seem d cors windingsheet
whose happi soul gone meet
the blest angel train

Or mark d sun declin ray
In thousand vari colour play
oer iceincrust heath
In gleam orang green
and red azur sheen
like hue die dolphin seen
most love death

Or seen dawn eastern light
the frosti toil fay night
On pane casement clear
where bright mimic glacier shine
and alp mani mountain pine
and arm knight palestin
In wind march appear

T enchant scene
the charm bestow d banish spleen
thi bosom pure light
but still nobler power claim
that power alli poet fame
which languag vain dar d name
the soul creativ might

though autumn grave summer fair
and joyou spring demand share
Of fanci hallow d power
yet hold humbler kind
To grosser mean earth confin d
through mortal sense reach mind
By mountain stream flower

but mine purer natur still
Is that thi secret
did minist unseen
unfelt unheard everi sens
did sleep drowsi indol
and silenc deep night intens
enshrowd everi scene

that oer thi teem brain rais
the spirit depart day
through vari year
and imag thing remot
and sound long cea d float
with everi hue everi note
As live

and taught thee motley mass
each harmon part class
like natur self employ d
and work d thi wayward
from rare combin skill
with newcreat world fill
Of space mighti void

Oh thi heart inclin
To whose plastick power combin
the harvest mind
To whose magic coffer bear
the spoil toil year
that still mental vision wear
A lustr refin d

she cea d and doubt mood
all motionless mute stood
like one charm opprest
By turn rov d
and turn lov d
for age neer could one prov d
more love rest

Oh bless band birth divin
what mortal task like mine
and spoke
when lo pour d flood light
So fierc ach sight
fell beneath vision bright
and pain woke




the two painter A tale



say everi work man
some imperfect mar plan
whi join d everi human art
A perfect imperfect part
Is life art short
Or natur cruel sport
Or would thu moral teach
that man see never reach

Or consequ pride sloth
Or rather effect

fear ala say last

onc time charon wherri

and though zealou spite strove
To blast fame

while scorn either nostril play d

We rival agre
and therefor inclin d
To cherish one humbl mind
who apprehend one
can never condescend love

nor longer courteou guil
like serpent twist smile

and poison envenom d prais

and roll fierc glassi eye

As set old charon phlegm fire

and exclaim d fourth would ask

To write grave taught

Or whether world discern d

Of breaker high dash around

from object object still still would veer
though noth ala could find
like moon without atmospher brilliant clear

Ah sad myrtilla cri
To wast alon year
while oer streamlet flowri side
she pensiv hung watch d tide

the world though oft merit blind
ala blame
for oft knee inclin
and pour d sigh like wind
Of winter cold came

Ah neglect rue
then oer limpid stream
she cast eye ether blue
her watri eye look d view
their loveli parent beam

and ever sad lament
would thu lip divid
her lip like sister rose bent
By pass gale elastick sent

while mourn oer pictur d face
did glanc steal
she seem d thought marbl grace
T enslav love human race

Ah avail eye replet
with charm without name
ala kindr ray meet
To kindl collis sweet
Of mutual love flame

Oh t worst cruel thing

yon bird trim purpl wing
As bend bow swing

the littl glowworm shed light
nor shed light vain
that still tini lover sight
amid dark night
may trace oer plain

all live natur seem move
By sympathi divin
the sea earth air
As one univers love
did heart entwin

My heart alon kind
No love ever warm
that resembl find
with wast arabia wind

A blank embodi space know
No chang reign
save fierc tornado throw
it barren sand like drift snow
In ridg oer plain

A youth beheld extaci

forbear oh love maid forbear

nor arabia wast compar

To everi charm alli

Or arabia rather say
where delici spring
remurmur leav play
mid palm date flowret gay
On zephyr frolick wing

and methink deem
the pictur els true
for wandr travller seem
oer life drear wast without gleam
Of hope you

thu spake youth tongu
such convers sweet distil d
It seem d word hung
As though heavenli spirit sung
and soul fill d

He told cruel fate
condemn d along rove
from infanc man estat
though court fair great
yet never love

and mani poet page
the blest revers prove
how sweet pass life pilgrimag
from purpl youth sere old age
aye love belov

here ceas youth still word
did oer fanci play
they seem d matin song bird
Or like distant low herd
that welcom day

the sympathetick chord feel
soft thrill soul
and sweet vibrat steal
through everi vein tender peal
she seem hear roll

her alter d heart late drear
then seem d faeri land
where nymph rosi love appear
On margin green fountain clear
and frolick hand hand

but shall paint crimson blush
nor think hand stone
As secret flush
did oer ach sens rush
her heart

the happi lindor look
that everi hope confess
her glow hand exult took
and press d fear shook
In silenc breast

myrtilla felt spread flame
yet knew chide
So sweet mantl oer frame
that smile pride shame
she d bride

No longer ye fair complain
and call fate unkind
the high low meek vain

while equal cluster knit
On either side circl flit

Or harvest holliday
lead danc along
If luci chanc cross way
So sure lead wrong

If attempt pipe play
and catch luci eye
the trembl musick die away
and melt sigh

where go where turn
If luci found
seem shiver yet burn
My head goe swim round

bear see smile
unless smile
and frown sigh
but know whenc

Ah luci done
To caus much stir
from rise set sun
sigh think

In vain strive join throng
In social mirth eas
now lone wood stray among
for wood pleas

Ah restless heart fear
will never rest
till luci ceas live tear
her imag breast




the complaint



Oh colin win eas
said lindor sigh
So carelessli ordain pleas
d everi care defi

If colin daphn hair
A simpl garland weav
He give sweet air
He seem crown give

but though cull fairest flower
that deck breast spring
and posi woodland bower
for daphn bosom bring

when attempt give fair
with mani speech store
My halfform d word dissolv air
blush dare

and shall expect smile
from daphn love
when everi word look
My clownish weak prove

oft close summer day
when daphn wander d
ve left littl flock astray
and follow d sigh

yet fear approach near
linger far behind
and lest step reach ear
shook everi wind

how happi must colin
who never knew fear
whose sweet address liberti
command fairon ear

A smile tear word sigh
stand readi call
In unknown live die
who feel

Ah simpl swain littl know
the lovesick mind scan
those gift real love bestow
To mark favour man

secur let fluent parrot feign
the musick dove
T eye may reign
the eloqu love




will maniac

A ballad



hark wild sound breez
T will even fall
who sing yonder wave tree
that shade prison wall

poor will gayest swain
At villag danc seen
No freer heart wick stain
eer tripp d moonlight green

hi flock humbl pride
A finer neer shorn
and lambkin die
had will caus mourn

but poor william brain turn d
He know flock
for ask d mourn d
He mock d villag clock

No william mourn fold
though tenantless drear
some say love never told
did crush heart fear

and t said pin d
wa heiress land
A love ladi pure mind
Of open heart hand

and other tell how strove
To win nobl fair
who scorn jeer d simpl love
and left despair

will wander d amid rock
through live long day
and oft would creep burst shock
had rent earth away

He lov d delv darksom dell
where never pierc d ray
there wail nightbird tell
how love turn d clay

and oft upon yon craggi mount
where threaten cliff hang high
have observ d stop count
with fixless stare sky
