AS joseph wa awalk

old english carol


As joseph awalk
He heard angel sing
thi night shall born
our heavenli king

He neither shall born
In housen hall
nor place paradis
but ox stall

He neither shall cloth
In purpl pall
but fair white linen
that usen babi

He neither shall rock
In silver gold
but wooden cradl
that rock mould

He neither shall christen
In white wine red
but fair spring water
with christen

mari took babi
she dress him sweet
she laid him manger
all sleep

As stood him
she heard angel sing
O bless dear saviour
our heavenli king



the peac night

john milton


but peac night
wherein princ light
hi reign peac upon earth began
the wind wonder whist
smoothli water kist
whisper new joy mild ocean
who hath quit forgot rave
while bird calm sit brood charm wave

the star deep amaz
stand fix steadfast gaze
bend one way preciou influenc
and take flight
for morn light
Or lucif often warn thenc
but glimmer orb glow
until lord bespak bid
go

and though shadi gloom
had given day room
the sun withheld wont speed
and hid head shame
As inferior flame
the newenlighten world need
He saw greater sun appear
than bright throne burn axletre could bear

To see magic fin would rise
some high rock forc leap
To see wing fall sky

some pin upon tall spear
some toss shield brazen clang
To see blood tear
their god would hear hymn sang

but oarsmen flung oar
and laugh see across foam

made delic music far away
A hillfox bark lair
the white owl hawk shadowi prey

but rise moon
the druid came grove glen
and chant rune
crucifi st columba men

they die silenc side side
but first sang even hymn
By midnight one die
At dawn grey grim

one monk alon modr kept
A youth hair goldenr
who never sigh wept
not bow proud young head

broken lay bound thong
thu seen brother toss
like crow transfix upon great prong
till death crept silent cross

night grew dawn scarlet morn
day wane firelit starlit night
but still eye passion scorn
He dare worst modr might

when wattlewoven hous
nial mighti softli step
and peer beneath ashtre bough
To thought whiterob slept

He heard monk word rise prayer
He heard hymn ascend breath
christ son god thee fare
thi night upon wing death

nial mighti cross space
He wait till monk ceas
then lean oer foamwhit face
He stare upon dauntless priest

speak low said tell
who king hold great

though modr taunt hate

and bond ach bodi keep

and carest live die
monk hast thou littl care life

great care said
and look nial eye fire
My life begin dead

nial mighti sigh thi word

Or clash triumphant sword
when modr bring foray home

My name nial nial strong
A lad year see

Or lordli men

To modr come far
oer mani hill strath stream
To mighti sword war
and dream dream

My dream strength great
should serv greatest king
modr pict thu men rate
and sought faroff liss

but greater yet
A king god doth fear
My servic shall get
My strength shall rust longer

the monk face gladden Go go
To modr go sitteth dumb
and brood fain would know
and say o king cross come

then shall king aris wrath
and bid go sight
for meet path

Go forth seek lone place
where great river fill wild

with flower everi love hue

the monk face whiten like seafoam

An hour dawn rose
and sought modr brood dumb
O king said bond close

He stare pass without word

befor flush dawn red
A druid came nial great

A greater modr hath appear
To him sword strength bring

all day night walk afar
He saw moon rise white still
the even morn star
the sunris burn upon hill

He heard moan sea
the vast sigh sunswept plain
the myriad surg foresttre
saw dusk night return

At fall dusk stood
upon wild desert land
dark fruit gather food
drank water hollow hand

cut ash mighti bough
and trim shape half
safe desert
with sword said staff

Oh hie ye ye maiden hide ye

Up comrad stand broadsword hand
for war great odin delight
and thunder proud laugh cloud
when norsemen prepar fight

and light galley bore fierc crew shore
and naught good come forebod
and wail rose high stormriven sky
As burislav castl strode

then stoutheart men sir burislav train
To gateway came throng full fast
and battleblad rang murder clang
born aloft wing blast

and hew thrust till man bit dust
their fierc valor avail naught
but thunder proud laugh cloud
when saw norsemen fought

then came burislav forth men north

O ye warrior name ransom ye claim
Or gold robe fee

Oh reck thi gold quoth earl sigurd bold

for vengeanc speed fast come like blast
Of night oer billowi brine

To fro merri word flew lightli

and scald nimbl finger oer

now strain laughter rippl
hidden woe wept
for sang time begin ere sun

while thi worn soul thou refreshest

while mighti soul rose upward

Lo cri came bid thee bale
