the second chapter solomon song


As sharon field blush rose
doe chast bosom morn disclos
whilst around zephyr bear
the fragrant odour thro air
Or lilli shadi vale
doe oer flower beauteou pride prevail
and stand dew kindest sunshin blest
In fair preemin superior rest
So love happi influenc shed
hi eye bright sunshin lover head
then shall rose sharon field
and whitest lilli beauti yield
then fairest flower studiou art combin
the rose lilli join
and unit charm less mine

As much fairest lilli surpass
A thorn beauti height grass
So love among virgin shine
adorn d grace half divin
Or tree gloriou behold
Is hung appl ruddi gold
hesperian fruit beauti high
extend branch ski
So love virgin eye invit
T alon fix wandr sight
among ten thousand emin bright

beneath pleas shade
My wean limb eas laid
and fragrant bough reclin head
pull d golden fruit eager hast
sweet fruit pleas tast
with sparkl wine crown d bowl
with gentl ecstaci fill d soul
joyou sate beneath shadi grove
and oer head hung banner love

faint die labour breast
Is mighti weight love opprest
feel fire possess heart
and pain convey everi part
thro vein passion fli
My feebl soul forsak place
A trembl faint seal eye
and pale dwell upon face
Oh let love powr odour stay
My faint lovesick soul die away
one hand beneath let place
with tother press chast embrac

V charg nymph sion go
arm d sound quiver bow
whilst thro lonesom wood rove
you neer disturb sleep love
Be gentl zephyr
with downi wing fan air
let sacr silenc dwell around
To keep intrud sound
and balmi slumber leav eye
may joy unknown till aris

but see come majestick gate
He onward bear love state
now thro lattic appear
with softest word dispel fear
aris fairon receiv
all pleasur love give
for sullen winter past
No fear northern blast
No storm threatn cloud appear
No fall rain deform year
My love admit delay
aris fair come away

alreadi see teem earth
bring forth flowr beauteou birth
the dew softdescend shower
nurs newborn tender flowr
hark bird melodi sing
and sweetli usher spring
close fellow sit dove
and bill whisper love
the spread vine blossom swell
diffus round grate smell
aris fairon receiv
all bless love give
for love admit delay

As mate constant dove
fli thro covert spici grove
So let us hasten lone shade
there let safe thi lov d arm laid
where intrud hate nois
shall damp sound thi melodi voic
where may gaze mark beauteou grace
for sweet thi voic love thi face

IX As love thine
let thee ever mine
among lilli play
fairer love thou art
till purpl morn aris
and balmi sleep forsak thine eye
till gladsom beam day
