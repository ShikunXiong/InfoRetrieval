and mount clear blue sky
and hark merrili sing
As far away fli

lord fowl brute
O solitud charm
that sage seen thi face
better dwell midst alarm

My form indiffer see
they unacquaint man
their tame shock

societi friendship love
divin bestow upon man
O wing dove
how soon would tast
My sorrow might assuag
In way religion truth
might learn wisdom age
and cheer salli youth

religion treasur untold
resid heavenli word
more preciou silver gold
Or earth afford
but sound churchgo bell
these valley rock never heard
neer sigh sound knell
Or smile sabbath appear

Ye wind made sport
convey desol shore
some cordial endear report
Of land shall visit
My friend send
A wish thought
O tell yet friend
though friend never see

illustr

how fleet glanc mind
compar speed flight
the tempest lag behind
and swiftwing arrow light
when think nativ land
In moment seem
but ala recollect hand
soon hurri back despair

but seafowl gone nest
the beast laid lair
even season rest
and cabin repair
there merci everi place
and merci encourag thought
give even afflict grace
and reconcil man lot
