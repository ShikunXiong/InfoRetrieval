conjugi carissima


proem

they call mad poor old man
whose white hair worn thin
fell oer shoulder play
hi cherish violin
forev draw fro
oer silent string loosen bow

At time pathet face
A look perfect raptur shone
intent celesti chord
discern alon
and sometim would smile paus
As receiv loud applaus

So mani humbl poet dream
hi song touch human heart
and full hope offer lay
befor shrine art
poor dreamer may never know
that draw silent bow

MY promenad solitair

Up garden fair
under trelli grape bloom
with breath violet air
As pallid winter spring make room
walk ponder free care
In beauti promenad solitair

back forth checker shade
trace lattic hold vine
with glori snowcap crest display
On sapphir sky billowi line
stroll ask compar
with charm promenad solitair

To fro neath nascent green
which clamber slender frame
with white peak light scene
As snowfield glow sunset flame
saunter halt
for view promenad solitair

In silenc sweet
plash fountain song bird
are sound lov d retreat
By air ever stir
It like longdrawn aisl prayer
So hush promenad solitair

onward rush world without
but breez garden steal
bring mere distant shout
Or echo light pass wheel
In din drive share
As muse promenad solitair

Am dead world thu disdain
it moil toil prime life
when perhap score year remain
To win gold selfish strife
Am foolish choos purer air
Of gloriou promenad solitair

Ah from mountaingirdl height
watch game world go
and note cours bitter fight
and lost
and judg better
As gaze promenad solitair

It ever old tale greed
Of rob kill weaker race
Of word prove fals cruel deed
Of slander tongu friendli face
T enough make one heart despair
even promenad solitair

they cheer struggl beat air
with mani stroke thrust intens
and urg dare
To gain good deem immens
but look like ant contend
from height promenad solitair

backward forward run crawl
hous treasur heap high
hither thither booti haul
then suddenli drop track die
for wise enough repair
In time promenad solitair

meantim earth speed space
As sun million year hath steer
and eon henc entir race
will play part disappear
but lifeless planet care
As follow promenad solitair




reincarn

know know
but heart mystic lore
feel breath air
and walk earth

and latest form
My oldtim spirit strive
As fought mani storm
In past forgotten live

not inexperienc soul
thi incarn threshold tread
not recordless prove scroll
It brought back dead

To certain special line thought
My mind intuit tend
and old affin brought
not new ancient friend

what thrill previou state
rekindl ancient flame
what instinct love hate
knew came

and land youth dream
and read heartmov long see
when realli visit seem
not strang known

when mozart still child untaught
ran joyou silent key
and inspir finger wrought
majest harmoni

there fell upon psychic ear
faint echo music known
befor natal advent
In former live outgrown

In mani dumb brute wist eye
A dawn human soul aspir
for thu lower form rise
ourselv spirit sire

full mani thought thrill breast
Is fruit result seed
sown elsewher soul impress
By mani arduou deed

full mani fetter hath lame
My struggl spirit upward flight
wa spirit frame
when light

with justic therefor come pain
that oer tortur world extend
and hope lessen stain
As lifecycl end

No changeless endless state await
the good evil soul set free
each grave success gate
In immort

too long mighti truth hath slept
among darken soul men
Ye see god face except
Ye shall born

the godlik christ buddha yearn
howev high spirit stage
for man salvat return
As saviour sage

On benight grope mind
their nobl precept starlik shine
each soul wise seek find
the truth divin

misunderstood vilifi
their aim motiv scarc known
how mani saint die
reject

yet though follow miss way
In spite precept prayer
and lead unnumb soul astray
commit care

upon lofti spiritplan
where lie open sight
the master know vain
they left hill light




TO the ring nebula

O pallid spectr midnight sky
whose phantom featur dome night
elud keenest gaze wist eye
till amplest lens aid fail sight
On heaven blue sea farthest isl fire
from thee whose glori would fain admir
must vision baffl despair retir

what art thou ghostli visit flame
wouldst thou neath closer scrutini resolv
In myriad sun constel frame
around lifeblest satellit revolv
like unnumb orb nightli creep
In dim process oer azur steep
As whitewing caravan desert sweep

Or art thou still incandesc mass
acquir form hostil forc urg
through whose vast length continu lightn pass
As fro fieri billow surg
whose glow atom whirl ceaseless strife
where chaotic anarchi rife
shall yet becom fair abod life

We know faint exhaust ray
which hither light wing courser come
from fire age sinc first lit blaze
one instant gleam perish spent dumb
how sad thought howsoe yearn
Of life yonder glitter orb learn
We read messag could none return

yet know yon ring spectral light
whose distanc thrill soul solemn awe
can neer escap majest might
the firm control omnipres law
thi mote descend bounden place
those sun whose radianc scarc trace
alik obey power pervad space




the waif

sit luxuri chair
soft rug caress slipper feet
within balmi summer air
without wintri storm sleet

A favorit book hand
A thousand other line wall
some souvenir distant land
In everi nook past recal

upon turkish tabouret
In dresden cup peerless blue
gleam pretti cashmer tray
the fragrant mocha ebon hue

two dainti hand prepar draught
while love glanc meet
two lip repeat coffe quaf
tonight t sweet alon

hark court faith hound
break rude teteatet
too well understand sound
A mendic gate

admit ye none shall say
that seek want door
Is ever harshli turn away
hi plea heard noth

leav comfort sigh
and pass outer hall
behold wander doom die
So ill look see fall

know stori ere speak
and listen labor breath
trace tear upon cheek
hi long hopeless fight death

A poor stormbeaten lone waif
lure southward colder clime
By hope unfail faith
that health come time

ala late dread diseas
hath fix root firmli
and sick friendless knee
He pour forth heartbreak prayer

what need befor food
hot soup bread wine last
A sens human brotherhood
obliter cruel past

yet long though wellf
with warmer garment
He hath place lay head
On turn friendli door

slip silver hand
twill purchas shelter night
then silent remors stand
To watch bent form sight

On goe snow sleet
with noth warmth cheer
from home street
Ah kept

My room less bright warm
but charm joy fled
that lone figur storm
leav heart uncomfort

for one tini wave
In life vast shoreless sea woe
one note man hoars cri save
resound oer ebb flow

ask blank dismay
ought littl wealth
yet give away
twere drop ocean thrown

great god dimli see
In small section mankind
Of pain want miseri
can thu bring anguish mind

how canst thou view aw whole
As ensanguin planet roll
from unknown sourc unknown goal
it freight suffer human soul

permit pain first last
Of riddl strive solv
more poignant ever vast
As man mental evolv

hear thi victim ceaseless wail
view path race hath trod
and sight spirit quail
and cri agoni god




the silver heron

within home captiv beast
whose world dwindl cage
note mourn eye
such resign fear rage
long set free
and send land sea
To live liberti

for mountain rang
the desert vast jungl lair
their meaner fate grate bar
To feel public hate stare
poor prison doom henceforth pace
with stint stride narrow space
and daili gape crowd face

At length stood cage
where guard loftier screen
were artifici rock pool
and strip veget green
there perch upon rocki mound
Or crouch miri ground
A flock waterfowl found

stork pois upon singl leg
stood dream etern nile
the mecca winter flight
when lure egypt sunni smile
while duck gees gabbl mood
explor muddi pond food
attend noisi brood

their keeper brought even meal
and instantli broadweb feet
and stiltlik leg flap wing
the feather bipe rush greet
with snap cluck delight
the joy everwelcom sight
Of supper approach night

yet came two stood apart
with plumag like freshfallen snow
two silver heron race
As pure fine earth show
amid tumult rife
these loath other greedi strife
and look disgust life

with close eye shrink mass
they seem thought remov far
from coars environ
As sun separ star
the pictur disdain
from gorg plain
they determin refrain

the keeper murmur reproach
those silver heron proud
whi partak food
togeth common crowd
they eat littl hand
but would prefer starv stand
besmear uncleanli band

A month henc neither
for griev death
and one fall mate expir
with scarc addit breath
and come anoth pair
In turn fate share
Of two heron stand

poor hapless bird see yet
alon starv pride
their glitter plumag still intact
while stand brave side side
and although put hunger test
continu mute protest
against defil rest

O silver heron teach mankind
To cherish thu stainless name
To shun vile ignobl crowd
prefer death smirch shame
A foul unfriendli mob brave
and go unspot grave
Is lose one life save




TO the sphinx

O sleepless sphinx
thi sadli patient eye
forev gaze oer shift sand
have watch earth countless dynasti aris
stalk forth like spectr wave gori hand
then fade away scarc last trace
To mark secret dwell place
O sleepless sphinx

O changeless sphinx
the dawn time
beheld thee sculptur live rock
still wear thi face primal look sublim
surviv hoari age shock
still royal art thou thi proud repos
As sun tune memnon rose
O changeless sphinx

O voiceless sphinx
thi solemn lip dumb
time aw secret lie within thi breast
age follow age rever pilgrim come
from everi clime urg request
that thou wilt speak poor creatur day
In calm disdain thou seest die away
O voiceless sphinx

majest sphinx
thou crouchest sea
whose fawnhu wavelet clasp thi buri feet
whose desertsurfac petrifi like thee
gleam white sail mani arab fleet
whose tawni billow surg storm
break thi flank overleap thi form
majest sphinx

etern sphinx
the pyramid thine
their giant summit guard thee night day
On thee look star splendor shine
Or around crest sunbeam play
thine coeval thee remain
coloss genii boundless plain
etern sphinx




youth and age

gain fortun young man cri
for gold world deifi
henc whether mean foul fair
make millionair
My singl talent shall grow ten
but old man smile ask and

A peerless beauti young man said
shall woman choos wed
and men shall envi prize
and women scan jealou eye
and look annoy
the old man smile ask and

build answer home fine
that king castl shall covet mine
the rarest pictur shall cloth wall
and statu stand state hall
It shall lack luxuri known men
but still old man ask and

play role church state
that mankind shall acknowledg great
win last brilliant fame
that distant land shall know name
for wield sword pen
but old man ask and

Is heart stone young man cri
hath ambit within die
that noth seem worth
what mean sphinxlik smile
Of secretli think
you utter mourn word and

gentli old man said O youth
the word spoken veil truth
learn laps year
and first discern mist tear
for youth full illus fair
which manhood see dissolv air

your million make blest
they rob instead peac rest
your beauti wife may prey
Of treacher friend skill roue
and splendid palac crave
will make societi gild slave

T weari road polit fame
it price must often pay shame
and worldknown name yearn
On bulletin board funer urn
Is scarc worth toil strife
which poison peac joy life

for ever wise good
By misunderstood
and fame bring enviou foe
To spoil mani night repos
and ala pathway upward tend
you find selfinterest friend

the loudest shout mob applaus
will die moment paus
and greatest public prais
To one whose form earth decay
the cruel world alway laugh
At fulsom lie epitaph

but spring reck winter snow
and believ know
that boon tempt power
If gain like fragil flower
whose fresh wilt fever hand
like rose drop desert sand

and much work deem sublim
Is like grain pinkhu lime
which coral insect shell
but microscop cell
entomb countless billion
In lone reef unknown shore

ala said youth eye wet
Is old age mere vain regret
the retrospect wast year
Of fals ideal lost career
advis what must reject
and perman good select

belovd youth old man said
all vain comfort
seek thine other joy
ring true like gold without alloy
wast thi time ask whi
Or whenc whither die

the actual world present hour
will give enough tax thi power
At clear duti hesit
serv well thi neighbor state
So shalt thou add thi tini form
To bind reef breast storm




sunset AT interlaken

the sun low
yon peak snow
Is redden neath sunset glow
the rosi light
make richli bright
the jungfrau veil snowi white

from vale sleep
night shadow creep
To take possess steep
while rise
the western sky
seem loath leav fair prize

the light day
still love stay
and round pearli summit play
how fair sight
that realm light
contend day night

now fainter shine
As day declin
the lustrou height resign
the shadow gain
Th illumin plane

which brow bosom rush
are pure fair
beyond compar
resplend crystal air

and thu alway
By night day
her vari suitor homag pay
and ting rose
Or white snow
the fair radiant form show




under the star

the breath summer stir tree
A thousand rose round bloom
whose saffron petal give breez
A wealth exquisit perfum
As climb high tendril bold
they cloth wall cup gold

No sound disturb silenc sweet
the weari bird sunk rest
for snow sunset meet
the light fade west
and cark care day
slip lightli heart away

the empti social strife
the petti human soul
the cheap frivol life
the keen pursuit paltri goal
how small seem beneath dome
that shelter tyrolean home

A shine mote tini earth
No furrow leav shoreless space
what one brief exist worth
which disappear leav trace
that silent starstrewn vault surviv
the dawn dusk countless live

whi griev dear heart oblivion deep
will soon enshroud friend foe
and laugh weep
must join host long ago
whose transient hour smile tear
make earth wilder year

the sunset glow ember die
the snowpeak lose crimson hue
through deepen shade ruddi sky
burn slowli darkest blue
wherein million world light
announc come night

gaze slowli despair
At human wretched crime
give place hope vision fair
So much may evolv time
So much may yet men soul surpris
beneath splendor god sky

some day somewher realm afar
hi light may make problem plain
and justic happier star
may recompens planet pain
and earth bleak golgotha woe
grow love life afterglow




corsica

In bordighera grove palm
linger close day
and watch beyond ocean calm
A rang mountain far away

their snowi summit white cold
flush crimson like tint shell
As sink sun cloud gold
behind peak esterel

No unsubstanti shape
the offspr mist sea
No splendid vision cathay
recal dream reveri

their solid bastion tower high
though root earth primal plan
proclaim everi passer
the cradl corsican

what martial soul found rebirth
when cliff scarc known
there visit earth
the spirit call napoleon

three island like sister fate
hi lifethread wove upon loom
from fair ajaccio silver gate
To saint helena mourn tomb

the first birthplac whenc appear
hi bale star lurid glow
next elba world still fear
the fugit fontainebleau

last england lone prisonblock
grim fragment neath tropic sky
where like prometheu rock
the captiv caesar came die

O corsica sublim wild
and riven wind wave
thi fame deathless thi child
whose glori fill million grave




TO the venu OF melo

O goddess grecian isl
whose shore blue aegean lave
whose cliff repeat answer smile
their featur sunkiss wave

An exil thi nativ place
We view thee northern clime
yet mark thi majest face
A glori still undim time

through calm lip proud goddess speak

where melian lover throng seek
thine aid love paradis gain

and saffron east
day jewel gate open flung
with state pomp attend priest
drew back veil thee hung

and dare kiss morn
empurpl made thi charm fair
sweet strain unseen minstrel born
awok dream perfum air

vouchsaf last mind free
from doubt pertain thi charm
the mean thi bend knee
the secret thi vanish arm

wast thou truth conjoin mar
did thi fair hand shield embrac
the surfac whose golden bar
grew love thi mirror face

Or bright scroll fame

upon thou didst trace name
Of fierc god dear thee

whate thou hadst mere delight
wa thine glitter prize hold
not thine form met thi sight
repli burnish gold

unmind thi hand retain
thi gaze fix beyond
some dearer object held enchain
the goddess immort love

We mark motion thine eye
and smile heldst thou shield scroll
A tender lovegl surpris
that tell secret thi soul




mor leoni

when oer age lion steal
the instinct approach death
whose numb grasp vagu feel
In trembl limb labor breath
He shun garish light day
and leav mate whelp play
In mourn silenc creep away

from bush bush deviou trail
He drag hill hill
and old strength slowli fail
drink long mani mountain rill
until gain stifl moan
A height hate man unknown
where may die least alon

relax mighti claw
He lie half shroud mane
hi grand head rest paw
and heed littl save pain
As oer eye sad deep
the film death begin creep
the prelud etern sleep

As caesar reel neath stroke
and daggerthrust mani friend
drew oer face roman cloak
To meet unseen tragic end
So hath desertmonarch tri
with nobl digniti hide
from other die

and spirit seren
for stranger intrud
To view last pathet scene
Or mar sombr solitud
prone lone mountain crest
confront resplend west
the die lion sink rest

proud king beast thi death teach
mankind cheap display
more eloqu human speech
thi grand exampl show way
To pass life unheard unseen
and compos majest mien
death aw sacred screen

nay thou didst select place
where unobserv thi form could rest
till mother earth fond embrac
should hide ampl breast
like mose lone nebo land
thou hast sepulchr sand
unseen eye untouch hand

No pompou tomb shall ever rise
abov thi lone sunbleach frame
No epitaph wellturn lie
shall inscrib beneath thi name
No bell thee dirg shall ring
No choir besid thi grave shall sing
yet hast thou perish like king




A stori OF the sea

were ever told legend old
Of birth storm sea
you hear tale channel gale
As happen
On fear night fastnet light
with ireland lee

In good old day poet prais
As best man hath seen
the stormk hand might smite land
but sea remain seren
blow east blow west sunkiss breast
kept ever tranquil sheen

not singl trace came oer face
Of storm rage elsewher
No misti screen eer crept
the sun imag
and depth night gem light
By star crystal air

the fisherman laugh littl craft
If landsman felt alarm
for never gale ship assail
Or sailor suffer harm
there noth fear sky clear
and ocean alway calm

but shore
the human race increas
there cold heat snow sleet
and troubl never ceas
for wind rain beat grain
and plagu slew man beast

and even wors moral curs
that came like deadli blight
through men seiz whate pleas
On plea might make right
till fatal seed selfish greed
made life bitter fight

henc mani sigh watch tide
glide sunset sea
and long go gentl flow
To hope might
A realm peac sorrow ceas
and soul pain free

At last said We better dead
than endur anguish
let us seek relief care grief
far stormswept shore
the sea bring sadder thing
than life live

So ship frame fondli name
the peac human mind
and weari band soon left land
and ceaseless strife behind
but unattain goal remain
they long find

for soul came quit
As sail
and pride hate abat
the hope voyag fail
and face alon great unknown
the bravest spirit quail

meanwhil ship began dip
and labor fro
for sea though fair could bear
thi load human woe
and last boat afloat
sank helplessli

down swirl nether world
while riven main
came gurgl sound drown
As vortex close
the sea surg back wont track
onc t sunlit plain

but soon men saw deepen awe
that sea grow white spray
it brilliant hue chang blue
To deathlik leaden gray
and sullen roar approach shore
whenc ship sail away

huge wave roll fright din
and spat hiss foam
and smote sand along strand
and swept mani home
and lightn flash thunder crash
from heaven inkblack dome

ala cri brother die
In depth sea peac
they brought unrest quiet breast
which nevermor shall ceas
for peac lost must pay cost
and behold woe increas

In truth sinc mani men
have learn mighti deep
can heav swell seeth hell
when storm surfac sweep
for calm hath fled countless dead
are spoil love heap

but best lie rest
On cloudless summer day
and tigerlik forbear strike
but sate bask play
one seem hear psychic ear
it murmur wavelet say

No real relief care grief
Is found oer distant wave
the men sail find fail
and sink lone grave
In firm control man soul
Is alon peac crave




old hymntun

dear oldtim tune prayer prais
heard first besid mother knee

A spell free
If laps time gave liberti

listen crowd year
fade dreamlik life lo

So much love well know
those plaintiv air long ago

they tell vanish youth
Of faith flawless seem
befor pain quest truth
had prove much esteem
wa fondli dream

they make childhood live
and life fair dawn grow bright
while listen sweet refrain
sung sabbath wane light
glori thee god night

My mother voic pure strong
My father flute silveri tone
the littl household strength song
the childish trebl
hear  alon

sweet obligato hymn
whose word vanish tone recal
float oer earth scene grow dim
and life last linger echo fall
till silenc settl

O lord love sympathi
for creat life
how canst thou view thu placidli

Of war destruct train

Of earth air sea

yet daili shambl
A sea blood spill
and man nourish chiefli
from beast kill

and hunter still find happi
In see red wound
A sob deer liquid eye

what real signific
Of thine unchang smile
hast thou secret conscious
that grief worth

that sorrow consequ
Of former live sin
the spur goad us
A nobler life win

that pain imperman
As shadow hill
and nirvana blessed
will cure mortal ill

but agoni agoni
and small relief
If measur etern
life anguish brief

To heart break miseri
To everi tortur frame
the present pain paramount
nirvana name

moreov former live
bequeath weight woe
If come memori
To guid us go

If oer dark prenat void
No mental bridg cast
No thread howev frail link
the present past

still silent dispassion
Ah would might find
the key seren
that fill thi lofti mind

thou hast joy feel
A light see
injustic sin wretched
No longer sadden thee

No doubt thi sublim gaze
life mysteri grow plain
As final full recompens

To crush celesti wrath

T bitterest woe life

Or die canker borrow gold

Or forc lie couch pain

T oftenest lost deadli blight
Of societi pestilenti air
which blacken robe purest white

An enviou woman whisper word
A slander born cruel smile

Or possibl even fanci slight
for feast declin call delay
Or jealousi caus petti spite
Or wish higher social grade

T one combin

and slowli poison heart mind
till joy gener friendship end

oer unknown caus made chang

ask make matter clear
but ask lesson fail
let changel go howev dear
and shed tear love frail

Be slave friend migrain
nor let play hot cold
the master thyself remain
and key thine inmost heart withhold

for weep sue plead

and friend mood friend need
To learn worth love

TO the countess guiccioli after read her recollect OF lord byron

like one homeward bound distant land
describ strang clime vision pass fair
yet deftli hide other eye hand
A privat casket fill treasur rare
So favor countess thou dost say
Is noth thi secret left unsaid

and kiss sweeter far sung

At feel thi white arm throat
To love byron not youth
when ardent sens tempt reckless choic
but matur year keeney truth

last love best thou didst enjoy
thi happi fate see rival claim
A share thine without alloy
how must remnant thi life seem tame
yet thi recompens thou dost keep
thi friend lover safe everi chang
for loyal thi love fell asleep
and life death estrang




the death OF antoninu piu

through marbl gate ostia
where tiber meet sea
and hundr roman galley
strain leash free
stream flood sunset glori
from classic sea old
till rome seven hill stand gleam
and tiber turn gold

whi indiffer splendor
Do peopl throng street
what everyon demand
Of stranger meet
they heard ala rumor
that ere dawn regild sky
all world may mourn
for emperor must die

search O roman annal
Of ruler race
from zenith glori
To ultim disgrac
and earth perfect master
and noblest line
you yield greatest homag
To die antonin

for hold caesar sceptr
In love father hand
and heart soul given
To welfar land
through justic everi nation
hath beheld warfar ceas
and leav successor
rome gigant world peac

henc nation wait
In anguish suspens
for futur doubt
As love intens
By nile danub
from tagu rhine
there mourn among million
for man deem divin

now sunset glow fade
and even shadow creep
oer ashen face caesar
As lie seem sleep
but slumber faith
To duti small great
He alon sovereign
but servant state

unrebuk centurion
As sungod sink sight
make wont way caesar
for password night
and great antonin though consciou
that ere dawn soul must pass
As last imperi watchword
utter aequanimita

O thou noblest caesar
whose transcend virtu shine
like gloriou constel
oer bloodstain palatin
when latest sand run
from life exhaust glass
may thi calm courag
and thine aequanimita




the butterfli

watch today butterfli
with gorgeou wing golden sheen
flit lightli neath sapphir sky
amid springtim tender green

A creatur divin fair
So frail wraithlik sight
fear see melt air
As cloud dissolv morn light

with sudden swoop brutal boy
caught cap fan gold
and forc savag joy
upon path defil mould

then cautious ground well scan
He clutch darken helpless prey
and pinch within grimi hand
withdrew light day

ala fragil bloom gone
it gracil frame sore hurt
it silken pinion droop forlorn
disfigur dust dirt

it life moment sinc gay
So joyou dainti flight
wa slowli eb away
it toobrief day eclips night

meantim vandal face aflam
survey die grasp
yet knew grief sens shame
In watch final gasp

At last sail gold brown
Of textur fine color rare
came deathstruck slowli flutter
No cleav sunlit air

one happi harmless less
To bid us dream world sweet
gone like gleam happi
A glimps raptur  incomplet

yet shall say creatur fair
In god sight smaller worth
than dull lout watch
and death found caus mirth

for truth claim
An endless life beyond grave
but insect larger frame
whose soul may small save

sinc faroff time cave men fought
like famish brute bloodi food
and unnumb centuri sought
To rear nake whelplik brood

how mani million men die
from pole pole everi clime
An aw neverend tide
swept deathward shore time

like insect swarm sun
they flutter struggl mate die
and lifework scarc begun
are struck like butterfli

A million million less
what matter the earth roll
unmind mankind distress
Or race gone

thu roll globe ere man appear
and thu roll wrinkl crust
desert lifeless old sear
when man shall return dust

and IT last shall also die
henc measur etern scale
It rank butterfli
A world ephemer fair frail

man insect earth distant star
they differ degre
their transient live near far
are moment etern

yet somehow spirit cling
the faith man surviv sod
for poor insect broken wing
have rais thought earth god




after the storm

the duel war cloud
hath end day
their scintil electr blade
have ceas fear play
the pent furi hate
hath found last releas
and oer tempeststricken earth
brood hush peac

the pass hurrican
hath swept sultri sky
the clear atmospher
bring jubil surpris
the mountain peak glorifi
with freshlyfallen snow
and steal oer coronet
appear sunset glow

An hour sinc torrid heat
oppress languid frame
the wind khamseen breath
the solar touch seem flame
but air rejuven
the breez refresh bring
the lustrou leav drop diamond
the lark raptur sing

fear dear heart life darkest storm
shall likewis end light
behind blackest thundercloud
the sun shine clear bright
onc celesti height shall wear
their sheen spotless snow
and brave steadfast soul
the smile god shall glow




fallen

My countri father rear
As champion world opprest
whose moral forc tyrant fear
whose flag struggl freemen cheer
In clutch empir crest
thou art fallen like rest

not thi number wealth might
proud mistress contin
for rival nation sight
Of thi resourc view fright
thi progress without preced
not seen thi swift descent

reread stori thi birth
recal year conflict spent
To prove despair earth
that everi govern worth
Is realli base free consent
then view shame thi present bent

thou hadst place uniqu sublim
In mani land beyond sea
the victim despot crime
In thee latest born time
beheld land tyrant free
the sacr ark liberti

but old world lust land
infect thee dread diseas
hath left plaguespot thi hand
thi monster area still expand
for blind histori nemesi
thou wouldst alien race seiz

condemn profound disdain
all nation heartless greed
how couldst thou buy humbl spain
A peopl struggl attain
A freedom suit need
whi stultifi thi boast creed

thine aid thou mightst given
As franc aid gave thee
with thi son might well striven
and bloodrust fetter riven
but heaven name
shoot men aspir free

tread field thousand sleep
the bloodsoak field freed slave
what preciou memori still keep
for heart mourn eye weep
yet live hero gave
what die save

A union ye outstretch might
from snow palm sea sea
but pledg use strength aright
and evermor keep alight
the torch human liberti
Is union see

where histori martyr dare break
the power held race chain
see ghastli lynchingstak
where brutal mob vengeanc take
and sinc law cours restrain
gloat oer writh victim pain

race hatr born groundless fear
and narrow prejudic cast
now greet cultur black sneer
and bar high career
break like mad iconoclast
the nation idol past

No steadfast eye
protest tortur race moan
with hand uplift toward sky
their tyrant answer surpris
and newborn insol tone
these lynch cure

yet hope remain A path retrac
Is nobler persist wrong
A fault confess half effac
that land alon disgrac
which howev strong
toward spoil belong

My countri would god prais
might leav lip instead blame
So near part way
subject eager gaze
Of million jealou thi fame
retrac path end shame




aequanimita

watchword sublim rome imperi sage
tersest synonym selfcontrol
paramount precept stoic age
noblest motto lofti soul
would thou wert writ charact light
At everi turn greet rever gaze
and bid face life evil calm upright
unspoil alik calumni prais
with scienc slave fate
what come know know
grief suffer death touch us soon late
the master question meet blow
grant ye god life steadfast eye
and equanim die




dreamland

woke dream rare delight
and vision joyou land
where love one long sinc lost sight
walk blith hand hand

where everi brow free care
and youth sublim ideal shone
like planet alpin air
and death sad mysteri known

woke like bird wait
uncertain wend flight
My spirit linger gate
which close upon realm light

till slowli around grew clear
and light day
convinc still
though dream pass away

onc face world pain
Of quiver nerv sure decay
Of helpless brute million slain
To feed mankind singl day

Of shiver children scar blow
Of hunt bird tortur beast
Of war whose hideou programm show
it mean homicid increas

the old world greed hate
Of selfish act paltri aim
Of privat fraud venal state
Of deed doer steep shame

what marvel spirit shrink
from plung turbid stream
Or wake thu one think
that life better dream

sweet peac dreamland await
the favor hour pass
within thine asphodelian gate
beyond miseri men

To find old pleasur long sinc gone

Or els sleep life curtain drawn
and reawaken  nevermor

To outrag rome digniti old

and classic shore homer sung

their grandest work still far beyond reach

the breathless transfer men thought thing

and let gaunt hunger blanch thi peasant lip

Or let rot abyssinian grave

If t certain thou must dearli pay

and thou shalt feel fardist day

fain would find peac pagan shrine
unspoil yet vandal today
around whose shaft sweet wild rose twine
and whose marbl wall sunbeam play

there would dream day life sweet

Of racial hatr loathsom cant
Of gross corrupt tawdri tast
Of monster fortun world want

To huge labyrinthin mass

where emperor alarm could pass

the fatal draught lifeless fall
here caligula slain
when shriek disord brain

At everi turn pallid ghost

To join longdrawn murder host

japan old and new

the son japanes lord
A princ olden time
My hair white though black night
In youth earli prime
and ask
As past sadli scan
are better wors wa bless curs
that foreign brought japan

It bare two score year ten
sinc epochmak day
when foreign fleet summer heat
came sail bay
still ring ear father word
As watch breast wave
If stranger land nippon strand
We may one day slave

but stranger land ask trade
and perman open door
and deem best grant west
A foothold shore
their slave truth becom
yet fail find
that japan obey thousand way
the western mind

We sent son across sea
To learn western power
their mode life mode strife
and made larg
but els learn
that first great aim must
To possess fleet defeat
all rival sea

henc west hath yet devis
for slaughter men en mass
We copi bought stop naught
To make fleet first class
and lest might quit suffic
should enemi come sight
We made man throughout japan
A soldier train fight

but ala chang hath wrought
In million field
for costli ship take lip
the food harvest yield
they alway poor load light
compar load today
for thousand hand work land
are draft away

and sad scene sphere art
In fame
the finger left deft
As stranger came
for toil beauti sake
and time never paid
but sold art gold
and western market trade

never look good sent
So worthless seem
without sigh standard high
which prevail old regim
when even hilt daimio sword
wa work month year
and highest reward triumph score
wa prais artist peer

No soul peopl
It formerli sweet kind
and happi reign heart restrain
By unspoil gentl mind
but lust outer world
for power land gold
our son deprav till madli crave
what other hold

We borrow mani thing west
but one left alon
Of christian creed need
and thu far kept
for numer sect affirm
that way
and rest suppress
for lead mankind astray

but wors claim rival sect
and war clash creed
Is gulf heavenwid descri
between word deed
for He whose sacr name bear
wa known princ peac
and He taught practic wrought
would caus war ceas

they say truth use fight
for lord sea coast
but soldier one ten
not perman armor host
nor claim obey god
they worship west
but sinc true
that mock hi first behest

hi word love enemi
and never hostil act
To friend foe christian show
By whomsoev attack
but realli best prepar
To attack resist
and kaiser pray kaiser say
Go strike mail fist

We look abroad everywher
the spirit christ dead
men call him lord draw sword
In defianc He said
and haughti whiteskin christian race
hate men differ hue
and rob slay thousand way
with excus ever new

In north south east west
In vain nativ plead
By congo wave countless grave
where palefac glut greed
and china fate loom dark grim
As peopl note mean
that christian take gold stake
from rand philippin

We choos rule
Of sermon mount
and brutal fact nation act
with eye bankaccount
and see way shun
the clutch western power
Is learn kill christian skill
and make weapon

for like other bend
our neck white man yoke
and poor japan latest man
will answer stroke stroke
So watch tonight solemn sight
On breast moonlit bay
As gallant host hostil coast
prepar sail away

It life death nativ land
and fear may never see
those ship nobl men
return victori
and well know heart heart
As past sadli scan

MY lost friend

one one slip earth
and vanish depth space
and besid lone hearth
find none take place

never word fond farewel
fell lip ere gone
never hint sinc tell
If night came dawn

Or snow last night fell

what mean journey gloom
which must make alon

vain task strive
To learn secret fate
till sound muffl oar

across vast unchart sea

To sleep forget O bless guerdon

My fail heart grow weari burden

To sleep forget

though bright sky transient gleam glad
and sweet breath mani summer sea
yet haunt note sad
forev lure minor key
To sleep forget

Of petti soul whose joy defam
Of malic envi cruelti greed
each day suppli sicken revel
and make imper spirit need
To sleep forget

let other brave plan death tomorrow
and crave fresh progress toward higher goal
appal earth long tragedi sorrow
humbl ask one favor soul
when life sun set
To sleep forget

A zone still strang profound

upon whose verg wave sound
In muffl murmur break die

To catch least wing word
and though fail still smile feign
the poor pretenc heard

that smile it patho wring heart
Of mani friend yet conceal
the tear eyelid start
the grief piti feel

and awar distress
and sadli consciou
still brave speak dare confess

what raptur close door

No longer forc dimli read

Do thu ever fulli know
the boon leav far behind
the world dull tale crime woe
the gossip vacant mind

what loss realli gain

A compens pain
A quicken psychic sens

perhap fall last away

A voic divin gentli say
In tone reach alon ear

while other world sin
heard evil thing thee unknown
apart defil din
thi spirit grew strength alon

they must live return
To slowli earn thi strength soul
through suffer couldst thou learn

AT the villa OF the emperor frederick AT san remo

In rhythmic ebb flow

To feast gladden eye
On bud wake flower make
A perfum paradis

To guard sweet repos
that strength fail life prove frail

So fair yet forget

who fought death labor breath
and face great unknown

O spirit fatherland
O love changeth

A consecr spot

Of billow tempesttoss
In long roll german soul

besid stori shore
but lie neath northern sky
At peac forevermor
In calm deep untroubl sleep
whose secret none may know
while one one cours run

and warm heart one dream
Of splendor day

Of live die

A simpl peasant toil

A flood mellow sunshin fall
In golden wave roof floor

the fragment old funer urn

one vacant nich whose ampler space
betoken special love care
contain doubt sculptur face
abov hallow ash
while beneath faint letter spell
A faith woman fond farewel

how often love wing feet
she doubtless sought dear recess
To deck floral offer sweet
her sepulchr happi
whose script despit two thousand year
preserv memori tear

rome annal hint name
Of whose dust lay treasur
but could fleet breath fame
have made heart dear
A word tender outweigh
In woman soul world prais

what though remot pomp state
At caesar court could shine
less blest sure fate
upon lust palatin
and mutual love wherev view
Is life suprem beatitud

ala urn longer stand

that hung sweet rose rim
and vanish even bust

and bid droop heart reviv

MY garden

sweet garden wreath fruit flower
and dome blue tyrolean sky
within thi roseencircl bower
seclud curiou eye
find peac paradis

without world fierc strife yearn
In flood passion ebb flow
within shrine burn
reflect fire long ago
A stormi life calm afterglow

how sumptuou golden splendor
thi yellow rose give wall
like yonder glow sweet tender
that oer snow sunset fall
and spell soul enthral

how swiftli pass happi hour
besid thi palm beneath thi pine
As fountain crystal shower
watch sunlight gild thi vine
against snowpeak silver line

lean upon loggia rail
and view vineyard saffron sheen
it amber leav glori veil
the purpl grape hang
it long arcad gold green

and sight heart beat
with raptur hitherto unknown
As delight keep repeat
In love triumphant underton
all mine

then chill like steal
across vale set sun
A solemn thought truth reveal
how transient prize thu
how short time leas run

befor thought garden fair

Of thi wealth could save
At thou gavest grave

and wear littl live away
In fleet pleasur toil

A spring thi bud shall quicken
A summer bring thi bloom
A autumn sun shall thicken

when stranger must make room

when eye shall see vision
Of rotheck pyramid snow
and watch roseat hue elysian
creep even glow
As oer crest sun sink low

anoth pluck flower
whose seed love hand hath sown
anoth midday hour
will hear honey bee dull drone
where rose shall blown

abov peak pastur high
but heed lie

even thou wilt never miss thi master
thi vine flower bloom
the season round move faster
No bud quench torch flame
and naught chang name

yet shall joy succeed
In turn must thi charm resign

To join everlengthen line

To thee transient presenc

after the vintag

how vineyard charm told
As bask autumn haze
the frost king touch light cold
like persian king old
hath turn roof green gold
till hillsid seem ablaz

thread maze arbor fair
under saffron bower
watch crisp novemb air
through vinefram open
the ivi wall castl rare
and ruin roman tower

sapphir blue cloudless sky
white mountain wall
rainbowhu tint lie
lavishli spread forest high
where leav million flame die
As chill autumn fall

over slope sun shade
the terrac vine descend
like state step broad cascad
Or amphitheatr seat array
In fold sumptuou gold brocad
where red amber blend

love see rise sun
each terrac gain crown
when splendid dawn hath begun
from crest mountain hath
To gild vinerow one one
As mellow glow creep

and day reced light
desert vale
trace noiseless upward flight
through darken zone foliag bright
till world lost night
save pyramid snow




the pass moon

In loggia bright watch tonight
the full moon sail
from crystal creek glacier peak
It slip open sky
and ride free clear blue sea
with island nigh

through pearli haze light display
each buttress mountain side
and softli shine state pine
where feudal castl hide
and everi height grow dazzl white
In foam silver tide

from eastern side valley wide
To snowcap western rim
It hold way till dawn day
shall made disk grow dim
then leav blue drop view
behind mountain brim

whenc climb path sublim
ere left ici height
and go yonder snow
Is reach morn light
will face elsewher fair
when lost sight

whi ask T fruitless task
enough splendor fall
On tonight loggia bright
till scene soul enthral
T long time yet ere moon set
behind glitter wall

and even sink
below stainless crest
It seem last safe pass
To peac rest
like happi soul hath reach goal
In kingdom blest

also know go
nor whenc came
nor guess happi
Or strang new world may lie
beyond vale sail
beneath anoth sky

but moon soon
sink west
To eye appear rise
and glide fair free
So frail boat float
though tempestworn
may cross life brink seem sink
yet sail anoth sea

yet mile vineyard stori crown stori

the vineclad terrac descend mountain
like cascad rippl resplend gold

In varieg zone hue ascend

In autumn wearest thou thi fairest crown




the statu OF the empress elizabeth meran

she seat river
In robe spotless white
with love face illumin
By even tender light
but eye full sad
As weari day
and gaze toward ocean
while river glide away

At feet bed flower
overhead state tree
whose protect branch murmur
with pass breez
though hand retain volum
from page glanc stray
for thought ocean
As river flow away

As view chasten featur
feel rise tear
At thought anguish
through martyrdom year
for joy writ water
too imperman stay
and swept toward sorrow ocean
ere youth pass away

she captur morn
Of childhood careless age
and imprison palac
like linnet cage
and gild bar confin
To court prescrib display
which simpl natur hate
As slow year crept away

thu heart grew alway sadder
till sorrow one one
reach last tragic climax
In murder son
and brokenheart woman
As madman victim lay
By geneva placid water
while lifeblood eb away

henc marbl face seem troubl
As gaze stream
like angel hath waken
from fear earthborn dream
she wait sunset
Of tempestdarken day
but soul ocean
where river wend way

beneath cloudless vault blue
and sing like bird set free

through alpin ether crystal clear

diffus bless warmth cheer
enrich bodi mind soul
while music float oer stream
and made beauti seem dream

enraptur sun caress
and windless warmth mid peak snow
In careless quest happi
the gay world saunter fro
Or seat wellkept strand
enjoy music band

upon bench remot
whose dress betoken rank wealth
sat two poor waif whose weari pose
betray fruitless search health
An age coupl near end
unit yet without friend

but still brave tri smile
So warm sun fair scene
they could happi yet
ere death cold shadow crept
and music softli rhythmic flow
recal youth long ago

begon watchman voic exclaim
your rustic garb much poor
how come asham
In place play boor
from compani like withdraw
obey mandat law

the startl stranger meekli rose
and move away downcast eye
too wont cruel blow
To manifest least surpris
too humbl inquir
too timid attempt repli

poor outcast joyou stage
where welldress hundr stroll eas
with falter step bow age
they vanish slowli neath tree
but neither scan face
for fear fall tear trace

farewel sweet musicladen air
and sunshin shelter strand
follow outcast pair
are walk sadli hand hand
for vaunt charm hath fled
while remain uncomfort

Of state forest mountain bold
Of church fill treasur rare
and stori castl centuri old

and vesper bell softli rung

and yearn land young

live sun shine bright warm
On featheri palm terrac vine
yet oft sigh boreal storm
and sough wind northern pine
and though ear hath wont grown
To accent strang alien tongu
No speech hath half sweet tone
As languag learn young

and friend increas year roll

So dear day gone
and think sun sink low
and curfew bell life rung
shall turn home long ago
and die land young

there sleep beneath italian sky
A love island rich fame
In day old longedfor prize
and bear still honor name
A spot renown age age
An ancient roman heritag

A valu stronghold whose sake

Of olivegrov laurel tall

acqua fredda

By acqua fredda cloisterwal
paus feel mountain breez
and watch shadow eastward fall
from immemori cypress tree

like arm outstretch bless pray
those duski phantom downward creep
To lenno curv bay
the peac villag seem sleep

while mirror peak stainless snow
turn crimson neath farther shore
and sunset glow
thread diamond drip oar

but tremor break spell
and stir life languid air
It convent vesperbel
the plaintiv call even prayer

that prayer rise like sigh
from everi sorrowladen breast
when twilight dim garish sky
and day die west

ave maria miss
A mother love mother care
implor thee bring us bliss
We fondli hope thee share

how sweet clear soft low
those vesper orison sung
In rome grand speech long ago
forev old forev young

and chant exil band
expel franc scorn hate
how fare foreign land
Is life disconsol

have escap sight pain
Of social strife hopeless tear
doe life dark problem grow plain
As pass prayer tranquil year

know dare ask
their soul read god alon
but would live condemn
should paus cast stone

So full life hate greed
So vain world poor tinsel show
what wonder soul need
To flee sin woe

would join yet truth
feel leav prayer
that someth preciou youth
long lost treasur




the postern gate

chose love garden
beneath whose ivi wall
A lake blue wavelet murmur
As even shadow fall

A garden whose leafi window
frame vision alpin snow
On peak burn crimson
In sunset afterglow

and sweet seclus
built mansion fair
with mani classic statu
and eastern relic rare

and volum whose preciou page
hold wise said
the latest among live
the greatest among dead

and sat fragrant arbor
Of laurel palm pine
and held tranquil twilight
My darl hand mine

and said We happi
and let mad world go
it gold longer tempt us
still less pomp show

No shall care annoy us
and state tree
with natur art letter
our soul shall take eas

but brood grief pursu us
like evil bird prey
they lodg tree tall branch
they shadow cloudless day

they flew darken casement
and beat windswept shade
and oft sleepless midnight
We listen afraid

and daili came tide
Of folli crime woe
and one one kept die
the friend long ago

for past ever one master
and memori mock space
and troubl travel us
howev swift pace

and envi alway envi
though call foreign name
and perfidi greed malic
are everywher

thought left behind
that gloomi realm care
but realli one never leav
it shadow everywher

So learn last lesson
that wall gate key
can never exclud life sorrow
they enter pleas

and ever acquir
the perfect life crave

made journey oer sea
bade faith dog goodby
knew would griev
but dream would die
and could explain
that would come

At first mourn dog mourn
A lifelong master ador
till mind fear born
that never see

Ah everi boat intent
He watch crowd upon pier
while everi look motion meant
will he come Is he

At last mere rais head
To see steamer pass
then sank upon bed
and heav longdrawn plaintiv sigh
for could one explain
that would come

hasten back sea land
forc homeward remors fear
but glad bark swept strand
nor meet pier

climb step footstep fleet
and beheld near wall
though totter still upon feet

As week month crept away
while outer world grew dim
till endless night eclips day

what meant wake
and mid familiar thing grope
To hear old sound shore lake
yet wander darkli without hope

Of classic legend wrought stone
In thee thread art unbroken

and felt still brood oer thee
the oldtim geniu place
awar still ador thee
unchang time creed race

through thee came also inspir
for mani rare poetic thought
and oh much resign
thi sweet unchang smile hath taught

though thine past hath sorrow
though thi sylvan friend fled
thou still canst smile everi morrow
for natur live though pan dead

thou didst griev futil wail
when altar crumbl far near
when god scof faith fail
and worship lessen year year

abov thee still rose lofti mountain
befor thee lay lake divin
around thee sang crystal fountain

emili S grave

idli one day foreign town
In churchyard shade sat
By side littl cross stone
On woman name alon
A cypress whisper ear
that neglect
emili grave read
noth cross said
neither name bibl vers

So strang seem blood turn cold
At thought tragedi never told
the flower grass hum bee
were blith gay sun breez
yet kind hand ever strewn
sweet flower weed grown
and noth brighten lone mound
whose edg lost trodden ground
At length churchyard gate went
and ask woman old bent
who girl whose cross stone
bear noth save word alon
emili grave
ala answer mani year
hath pass sinc beheld bier
she young came humbl nest
and credul like rest
So stranger met one day
and caught net straightway
He said rich shine
like queen castl rhine
and win love took henc
To found pretenc
He base lie simpl maid
and weari soon girl betray
abandon home
she came sink mother door
Of shame grief quickli dead
for could lift head
and mother wish effac
all memori child disgrac

If anoth life heart life drawn
O youth flower unfold If blown oer death cold stream

with step seren steadfast
hi hand behind chain
went forth valiant hofer
To death disdain
that death valor foil
had oft iselberg recoil
In love land tyrol

the noisi drumbeat slacken
and silenc roar
when andrea dauntless

the sandwirt fetter still yet free
stood wall unbent knee

when told kneel answer
that never

stream and sea

A river flow desert land
On way find sea
and saw naught els glare sand
and scarc shadi tree

the distant star look night
and burn sun day
On crystal stream pure bright
but sea far away

sometim night littl stream
would sigh sea embrac
and oft would see dream
the longedfor ocean face

At last one day felt thrill
It never known
As reach brow lofti hill
and saw wavelap shore

and flung mighti leap
from crest hill
till water mingl deep
and name sea love
