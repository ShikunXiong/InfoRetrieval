TO helen


saw thee year ago
must say how mani not mani
It juli midnight
A fullorb moon like thine soul soar
sought precipit pathway heaven
there fell silverysilken veil light
with quietud sultri slumber
upon upturn d face thousand
rose grew enchant garden
where wind dare stir unless tipto
fell upturn d face rose
that gave return lovelight
their odor soul ecstat death
fell upturn d face rose
that smile die parterr enchant
By thee poetri thi presenc

clad white upon violet bank
saw thee halfreclin moon
fell upturn d face rose
and thine upturn d ala sorrow

wa fate juli midnight
wa fate whose name also sorrow
that bade paus gardeng
To breath incens slumber rose
No footstep stir hate world slept
save thee O heaven O god
how heart beat coupl two word
save thee paus look
and instant thing disappear
Ah bear mind garden enchant
the pearli lustr moon went
the mossi bank meander path
the happi flower repin tree
were seen rose odor
die arm ador air
all expir save thee save less thou
save divin light thine eye
save soul thine uplift eye
saw world
saw saw hour
saw moon went
what wild hearthistori seem lie unwritten
upon crystallin celesti sphere
how dark woe yet sublim hope
how silent seren sea pride
how dare ambit yet deep
how fathomless capac love

but length dear dian sank sight
into western couch thundercloud
and thou ghost amid entomb tree
didst glide away onli thine eye remained
they would not go never yet gone
light lone pathway home night
they left hope sinc
they follow lead year

they minist yet slave
their offic illumin enkindl
My duti to saved bright light
and purifi electr fire
and sanctifi elysian fire
they fill soul beauti hope
and far heaven star kneel
In sad silent watch night
while even meridian glare day
see still two sweetli scintil
venus unextinguish sun

the lili loll upon wave
wrap fog breast

Oh ladi dear hast thou fear

A wonder garden tree

thi chamber chang one holi
thi bed one melancholi
pray god may lie
for ever unopen eye
while dim sheet ghost go

My love sleep Oh may sleep
As last deep
soft may worm creep
far forest dim old
for may tall vault unfold
some vault oft hath flung black
and wing panel flutter back
triumphant oer crest pall
Of grand famili funer
some sepulchr remot alon
against whose portal hath thrown
In childhood mani idl stone
some tomb whose sound door

and lord love well
but first breath vow
felt bosom swell
for word rang knell
and voic seem his fell
In battl dell

but spoke reassur
and kiss pallid brow
while reveri came oer
and churchyard bore
and sigh
think dead delormi
Oh happi

and thu word spoken
and thu plight vow
and though faith broken
and though heart broken
behold golden key
that proves happi

would god could awaken
for dream know
and soul sore shaken
lest evil step taken
lest dead forsaken

Ah broken golden bowl spirit flown forev
let bell toll saintli soul float stygian river
and guy de vere hast thou tear weep never
see yon drear rigid bier low lie thi love lenor
come let burial rite read funer song sung
An anthem queenliest dead ever die young
A dirg doubli dead die young

wretch ye love wealth hate pride
and fell feebl health ye bless die
how shall ritual read requiem sung
By evil eye slander tongu
that death innoc die die young

peccavimu  rave thu let sabbath song
Go god solemnli dead may feel wrong
the sweet lenor hath gone hope flew besid
leav thee wild dear child thi bride
for fair debonnaire lowli lie
the life upon yellow hair within eye
the life still upon hair death upon eye

avaunt tonight heart light No dirg uprais
but waft angel flight paean old day
let no bell toll lest sweet soul amid hallow mirth
should catch note doth float damn earth
To friend fiend indign ghost riven
from hell unto high estat far within heaven
from grief groan golden throne besid king heaven

To sand upon shore

In ether danc
By etern stream

ala accurs time

A bloodr thing writh

In human gore imbu

In spring youth lot
To haunt wide world spot
the could love less
So love loneli
Of wild lake black rock bound
and tall pine tower around

but night thrown pall
upon spot upon
and mystic wind went
murmur melodi
then ah would awak
To terror lone lake

yet terror fright
but tremul delight
A feel jewel mine
could teach bribe defin
nor love although love thine

death poison wave
and gulf fit grave
for thenc could solac bring
To lone imagin
whose solitari soul could make
An eden dim lake

and midtim night
and star orbit
shone pale light
Of brighter cold moon
mid planet slave
herself heaven
her beam wave

gaze awhil
On cold smile
too cold cold
there pass shroud
A fleeci cloud
and turn away thee
proud even star
In thi glori afar
and dearer thi beam shall
for joy heart
Is proud part
thou bearest heaven night
and admir
thi distant fire

Of intermin pride
A mysteri dream
should earli life seem
say dream fraught
with wild wake thought
Of be
which spirit hath seen
had let pass
with dream eye
let none earth inherit
that vision spirit
those thought would control
As spell upon soul
for bright hope last
and light time past
and wordli rest hath gone
with sigh pass
care though perish
with thought cherish














the happiest day


the happiest day happiest hour
My sear blight heart hath known
the highest hope pride power

Of power said ye ween
but vanish long ala
the vision youth
but let pass


and pride thee

the venom thou hast pour
Be still spirit


the happiest day happiest hour

for wing dark alloy
and flutter fell
An essenc power destroy
A soul knew well
