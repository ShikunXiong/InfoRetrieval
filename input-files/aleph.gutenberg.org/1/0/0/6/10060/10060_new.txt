footnot pure contentandomi sempr questa ed ciascuna altro
cosa da ciascuno piu savio la dove io difettuosament parlassi esser
corretto non tacero che per molt osservazioni molti volti da fatt
mi sento inclinato creder che la terra da quell prime piant e da
quei primi animali poi che ella nei primi giorni del mondo produss
per comandemento del sovrano ed omnipotent fattor non abbia mai piu
prodotto da se medesima ne erba ne albero ne animal alcuno perfetto
imperfetto che ei se foss e che tutto quello che ne tempi trapassati
e nato e che ora nascer lei da lei veggiamo venga tutto dalla
semenza real e vera dell piant e degli animali stessi quali col
mezzo del proprio seme la loro spezi conservano E se bene tutto giorno
scorghiamo da cadaveri degli animali e da tutt quant le manier dell
erb e de fiori e dei frutti imputrid e corrotti nascer vermi
infin

nonn vide quaecunqu mora fluidoqu calor
corpora tabescunt parva animalia verti

Io mi sento dico inclinato creder che tutti quei vermi si generino
dal seme paterno e che le carni e l erb e l altr cose tutt
putrefatt putrefattibili non facciano altra part ne abbiano altro
ufizio nella generazion degl insetti se non dapprestar un luogo un
nido proporzionato cui dagli animali nel tempo della figliatura sieno
portati e partor vermi l uova l altr semenz dei vermi
quali tosto che nati sono trovano esso nido un sufficient alimento
abilissimo per nutricarsi e se quello non son portat dall madri
quest suddett semenz nient mai e replicatament nient

Se dovessi palesarvi il mio sentimento crederei che frutti legumi
gli alberi e le fogli due manier inverminassero una perch
venendo bachi per di fuora e cercando l alimento col roder ci
aprono la strada ed arrivano alla piu interna midolla de frutti e de
legni laltra maniera si e che io per stimerei che non foss gran
fatto disdicevol il creder che quell anima quella virtu la qual
genera fiori ed frutti nell piant viventi sia quella stessa che
generi ancora bachi di ess piant E chi sa fors che molti frutti
degli alberi non sieno prodotti non per un fine primario e principal
bensi per un uffizio secondario e servil destinato alla generazion
di que vermi servendo loro vece di matric cui dimorino un
prefisso e determinato tempo il qual arrivato escan fuora goder il
sole

Io immagino che questo mio pensiero non parra totalmento un
paradosso mentro faret riflession quell tanto sort di gall di
gallozzol di coccol di ricci di calici di cornetti ed lappol
che son produtt dall quercel dall farni da cerri da sugheri da
leeci e da altri simili alberi de ghianda imperciocch quello
gallozzol e particolarment nell piu gross che si chiamano coronati
ne ricci capelluti che ciuffoli da nostri contadini son detti nei
ricci legnosi del cerro ne ricci stellati della quercia nell galluzz
della foglia del leccio si vede evidentissimament che la prima e
principal intenzion della natura e formar dentro di quell un animal
volant vedendosi nel centro della gallozzola un uovo che col crescer
e col maturarsi di essa gallozzola va crescendo e maturando anch egli e
cresc altresi suo tempo quel verm che nell uovo si racchiud il
qual verm quando la gallozzola e finita di maturar e che e venuto il
termin destinato al suo nascimento diventa di verm che era una
mosca  Io confesso ingenuament che prima daver fatt quest mie
esperienz intorno alla generazion degl insetti mi dava creder
per dir meglio sospettava che fors la gallozzola nascess perch
arrivando la mosca nel tempo della primavera e facendo una piccolissima
fessura ne rami piu teneri della quercia quella fessura nascondess
uno de suoi semi il qual foss cagion che sbocciass fuora la
gallozzola e che mai non si vedessero gall gallozzol ricci
cornetti calici coccol se non que rami ne quali le mosch
avessero deposit le loro semenz e mi dava ad intender che le
gallozzol fossero una malattia cagionata nell querc dall puntur
dell mosch quella giusa stessa che dall puntur daltri animaletti
simiglievoli veggiamo crescer de tumori ne corpi degli animali
