onc rose bloom either cheek lili take place
and would talk love still silent stay
come come unto window watch pageant gay

No fond anxiou passion mourn bosom know
My cheek pale still silent true
for ah miss father face fierc alabey slew
and crave boon love thousand knight fain
To fight servic true yonder floweri plain
and love give give back

the braggart rebuk

If thou art brave battl hour
As thou art bold pleasur rout
If thou canst make lanc fli

If thou canst vega fight
As thou ladi eye canst prais
and show horseback half skill
that mark thee danc maze

Be sprightli festiv danc

If thou art readi field
As thou art nimbl squar
and canst front battl face
As though thou flirtest fair

If thou dost thi shine mail
As lightli thi festiv suit
and listenest trumpet call
As though thi ladi lute

and gamesom hour
thou flingest round rattl reed

If foe face face

when far away rank rang
and fierc fight begun

betak thee bloodi field
and let thi sword thi prais sing

Oh swift full mettl steed day bore

but mani greater conquest gallant men shall make
for heart high soul bent death victori

O whither cruel fortun wilt thou bid warrior fli
must seek thee ocean wind billow roar

with myriad water river avail
To quench ardent fire love rage breast
and sooth fever soul one hour rest
and muse bitter thought mustapha reach hast
A balconi till dawn day hous pace
and heart anxieti count oer oer
and dark night toward open twilight wore
upon balconi came caus sigh
but smile rosi lip light eye
O love zaida began gaze face
If presenc thi window burden thi peac
one pledg bestow upon one pledg love pray
and let kiss thi lili hand sail away

He rode meet wait fleet favor wind
but bodi went board left heart behind

let shrill fife flute sackbut ring
A summon admir salvo king

the love OF boabdil and vindaraja

where antequera citi stand upon southern plain

while chico proud granada king night day rest
for moorish ladi vindaraja love best
and naught give solac naught dri tear

and write royal chico granada far away
Ah long letter wrote tell state
In lone prison cell confin captiv desol
she sent moorish knight seal ring
He warden alhambra stood besid king
and come sent king antequera tower
To learn vindaraja fare within prison bower

and chico took note love trembl broke seal

Ah hapless lovelorn maid like captiv plight

the infanta sevilla and peranzuelo

upon toledo loftiest tower
sevilla kept height
So wondrou fair love
wa blind sight

she stood amid battlement
and gaze upon scene
where tagu run woodland
and flower glade green

and saw upon wide highway

He rode upon dappl steed
and arm bright

seven moor chain led
and one arm length aloof
came dog moor morocco shore
In arm doubl proof

hi steed swift counten
In warlik scowl set
and furiou rage curs
the beard mahomet

He shout gallop
now halt thee christian hound
see head thi captiv band
My sire fetter bound

and rest brother blood
and friend long free
and thou wilt surrend
ll pay thee gold fee

when peranzuelo heard
He wheel courser round
with lanc rest hotli press
To strike ground
hi sudden rage onset came

sadli march along crowd street
while trumpet hoars blare drum tempestu beat

for aliatar one sad morn

A hundr moor behind rode
fleeter wind courser strode
toward motril cours made
while foe castl town blockad
there aliatar brother lay
pent foe fatal day
woe work hour day
vault upon saddletre

To challeng foe welcom friend
nor knew hour near

sadli march along crowd street
while trumpet hoars blare drum tempestu beat

that day master knight sent
As sport joust bent
and aliatar way
By cruel ambush betray
with sword hauberk surround
and smite warrior ground
and wound deep everi vein
He bleed lie upon plain
the furiou foe deadli fight
hi scanti follow put flight
In panicstricken fear fli
and leav unaveng die

sadli march along crowd street
while trumpet hoars blare drum tempestu beat

Ah sadli swift news flown
To zaida silent town
speechless sat everi thought
fresh sorrow bosom brought
then flow tear larger flood
than wound tide blood
like dazzl pearl teardrop streak
the pallid beauti cheek
say love didst thou eer behold
A maid fair knight bold
and thou didst see die
and zaida tear agoni
the bandag thine orb draw tight
that thou mayst never meet sight

sadli march along crowd street
while trumpet hoars blare drum tempestu beat

not zaida eye wet
for soul shall neer forget
but mani heart equal share
the sorrow ladi bare
ye drink water sweet
where genil stream darro meet
all bold albaicin line
who mid alhambra princ shine
the ladi mourn warrior high
mirror love courtesi
the brave lament peer
the princ comrad dear
the poor deplor heart bleed
their shelter time need

sadli march along crowd street
while trumpet hoars blare drum tempestu beat

the hubbub busi crowd ceas dulcet sound
In one moment high low peac refresh found
the hoot nocturn owl alon silenc broke
while distanc could heard din wake folk
and midst silenc came sound zaida wept
for night long fear death wake other slept
and sigh sang aloud melancholi strain
and would wish die said though death free pain
for evil tongu thought win favor lie
had told bold gazul ordain die
and don moor attir put away
and stroke midnight xerez took way
and sigh sang aloud melancholi strain
and would wish die said though death free

she rode nimbl palfrey scarc could great gazul
excel ardent spirit heart full
yet everi step palfrey took turn head fear
To see follow track enemi near
and went sang aloud melancholi strain
and would wish die said though death free

To shun suspicion eye last left king highway
and took journey toward sevil thro bypath lay
with loosen rein gallant steed right swiftli ride
yet fear appear like rock rough waysid
and went sang aloud melancholi strain
and would wish die said though death free
pain

So secretli would proceed breath held
tho rise storm sigh snowi bosom swell
and made halt bent head hear
If footstep sound assur renew swift career
and went sang aloud melancholi strain
and would wish die said though death free
pain

her fanci silent air could whisper voic hear
ll make thee sacrific albenzaid dear
thi fanci took breath away lifeless sank length
and grasp saddlebow fear sap spirit strength
and went sang aloud melancholi strain
and would wish die said though death free
pain

she came sight proud sevil dark bade wait
till dawn alight kinsman gate
swift flew day last joy truth learn
that deceiv joy xerez return
and went sang aloud melancholi strain
and would wish die said though death free
pain

the blazon OF abenamar

By gloomi fortun overcast
vassal one held scorn
complain wintri world
and ladi left forlorn
the wretch abenamar mourn
becaus countri unkind
had brought lot woe
and foreign home resign
A stranger moor throne
and granada sat state
mani darl soul
He claim love insati
He foul face craven heart
had mistress knight
her bloom year beauteou youth
were abenamar right
but royal favor decre
A foreign tyrant reign
for mani galley own lord
and master sea spain
Oh hapli t zaida self
ungrat like chang sex
had chosen emir thu scorn

thi thought turn tear
the eye despond knight
As suffer past thought
hi labor present plight
hi hope disappoint turn
hi wealth held alien hand
hi agoni oer love betray
lost honor confisc land
and loyalti met
such ill requit king
He call page bade straight
A limner deft bring

In color mani new devic
and write suffer shield
No singl blazon would suffic
and first green field parch sear
A coal myriad blaze burn
and like ardent hope yore
At length dust ash turn
and miser rich gold
who lock away jewel bright
for fear thief gem may steal
which yet yield delight
A fair adoni done death
beneath wild boar cruel tusk
A wintri dawn pallid sky
A summer day turn dusk
A love garden green fair
ravag slash stroke steel
Or wast trim parterr
and trampl common heel
So spake brave heartbroken moor
until tear struggl sigh
turn fierc rage paint
He wait eager eye
He ask one would fetch steed
Of good mare reck
for womankind done wrong
and woman sex
the plume yellow blue white
from bonnet brim tear
He longer carri

He reck woman love
hi citi bid farewel
and swear return
nor granada seek dwell

and plume violet white
abov head seen
and twixt tassel crown
An emerald circlet shone

thou art hope alon
He rode upon dappl steed
with hous richli dight
and left side clank hung
A scimitar might
and right arm sleev cloth
Of tawni lion hue
and lancehead lift high
A turkish pennon flew
and reach daraja camp
He saw daraja stand
besid perfidi love
and clasp hand
He made wont sign
then linger
for jealou anguish fill heart
To see tender smile
He spur courser blood
one clatter bound took
the moorish maiden turn
Ah love look
Ah well saw hopeless fate
and jealou mood

In womankind

hi cheek anger burn
men saw gallant mien
To gloom rage turn
