A bit OF histori


Up time german sea fleet unit suffer

german raider case enemi come second best
sever german cruiser sent bottom

after occas like german would lie long behind
snug wall ventur forth open they held
british navi great awe treat lightli

but fact british abl keep german fleet
bottl victori though bloodless one practic
commerc germani shut It settl
question long german empir could surviv without
necessari food commod reach shore what littl
