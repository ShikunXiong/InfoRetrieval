illustr fateh muhammad

imagin small attic fifteen feet ten eav
chal fill smoke frankincens pungent eye
commenc water ceas open
air In one corner spread coars sheet coupl pillow
wall upon silent mahomedan bade us sign
reclin opposit corner panja speci altar smother
jasmin wreath surmount bunch peacock feather
immedi front earthen brazier live charcoal behind
brazier sat three person fateh muhammad musalman youth
curious larg dreami eye two old musalman beldam either
might sat model witch endor the three sat
unmov blink live charcoal save rare interv
elder two women cast hand fragranc upon brazier
wrap us fresh pall smoke billow round room
lap interstic rotten tile onli peacock eye
corner never lost lustr stare wickedli smokewreath
like head argu

then sudden youth shiver fell forward face
brazier rose sit postur eye close everi
muscl bodi taut though stricken sudden paralysi the
spirit enter whisper friend even spoke saw
youth throat work unseen hand knead muscl
forth lip echo word La illaha illallah illahi laho He
deep tranc curtain eye halfdrop look one
dead voic spoke voic fateh
muhammad La illaha illallah illahi laho word die away one
present pass two green lime left hand ask
sign fain journey lahor start tuesday next will
well said paus came answer set forth
tuesday star thi journey send thine agent
thursday go thyself need two day later As messag die
away trapdoor floor slowli tilt upward
open crawl obviou member dhobi class He slid forward
almost feet dream youth place two green
lime hand spoke say master wife hath written
countri bid go unto tarri road but work
toward purs light Is go La illaha
illallah illahi laho aye go unto lest evil hapli befal thee
much hid thine eye

thu seanc went forward for twenti minut odd waif
stray human crawl trapdoor obtain messag
good ill depart shadow silent come
among sever women one sought cure sick
child whimper symptom maladi mening expect
mutter friend doctor answer came swift sure bind
thou tawiz round brow carri shrine miran
datar whenc cometh thi help La illaha illallah illahi laho

the end came suddenli after last visitor vanish
floor dead silenc three minut fateh muhammad
wrestl spirit within chest heav hand
convuls grasp heavi air fell prone upon face lay
still the two old women move forward commenc make pass
bodi murmur charm wave sevenknot

As pass homeward street heard woman upper
chamber still sing prayer note hope cadenc

O dilruba tu gam na kho khuda hamen baham kare
