the battl autumn OF

the flag war like stormbird fli
the charg trumpet blow
yet roll thunder sky
No earthquak strive

and calm patient natur keep
her ancient promis well
though oer bloom green sweep
the battl breath hell

and still walk golden hour
through harvesthappi farm
and still wear fruit flower
like jewel arm

what mean glad plain
thi joy eve morn
the mirth shake beard grain
and yellow lock corn

Ah eye may well full tear
and heart hate hot
but evenpac come round year
and natur chang

she meet smile bitter grief
with song groan pain
she mock tint flower leaf
the warfield crimson stain

still cannon paus hear
her sweet thanksgivingpsalm
too near god doubt fear
she share etern calm

she know seed lie safe
the fire blast burn
for tear blood sow
she wait rich return

she see clearer eye
the good suffer born
the heart blossom like flower
and ripen like corn

Oh give us time like
the vision eye
and make field fruit tree
our golden propheci

Oh give us finer ear
abov stormi din
We would hear bell cheer
ring peac freedom
