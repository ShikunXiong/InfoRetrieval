ON the death OF carl maria von weber


weep word spoken
mourn knell hath knoll d
the master chord broken
and master hand cold
romanc hath lost minstrel
No magic strain
shall throw sweeter spell around
the legend almain

hi fame flown
To mani foreign land
hi lay sung everi tongu
and harp d everi hand
He came cull fresh laurel
but fate breath
and turn d march triumph
into dirg death

O knew lov d
for mighti mind
He bore meekli
hi heart kind
hi wildli warbl melodi
the storm round roll
are type simplic
and grandeur soul

though year ceaseless suffer
had worn shade
So patient spirit
No wayward plaint made
een death seem d loath scare
hi victim pure mild
and stole upon quietli
As slumber oer child

weep word spoken
mourn knell hath knoll d
the master chord broken
and master hand cold
the master chord broken
and master hand cold
