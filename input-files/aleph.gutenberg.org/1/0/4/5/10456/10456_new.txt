well said secret rite

when halfmoon set none

lay watch feet pass

led wait light gleam
from one chamberwindow came

her lip still murmur name
In sleep guard fell

the low wind shook darken pane
the far clock chime along hall

without creak chamberdoor

A dagger came besid bed

A red hand strike bosom white

Of scare household could hear

No rose bier spread
As maid mother mourn
pureheart one love dead

with hasti hand scarc prayer

count bernard gain land
cast forth forgotten thu grown
To manhood could die
die till aton
for great shame see

and one day soon hand ll lay
upon arm lighter touch
than ladi use play
they tap fan yet
A thrill freez everi limb
As dead clutch

To see kneel hear plead

with halflaugh watch need
At last good blade find heart

LE marai DU cygn

the massacr unarm unoffend men southern kansa
took place near marai du cygn french voyageurs

A blush rose
where rose never grew
great drop bunchgrass
but dew
A taint sweet air
for wild bee shun
A stain shall never
bleach sun

back steed prairi
sweet songbird fli back
wheel hither bald vultur
gray wolf call thi pack
the foul human vultur
have feast fled
the wolv border
have crept dead

from hearth cabin
the field corn
unwarn unweapon
the victim torn
By whirlwind murder
swoop swept
To low reedi fenland
the marsh swan

with vain plea merci
No stout knee crook
In mouth rifl
right manli look
how pale may sunshin
green marai du cygn
when deathsmok blew
thi lone ravin

In home rear
yet warm live
Ye wait dead
poor children wive
put red forgefir
the smith shall come
unyok brown oxen
the ploughman lie dumb

wind slow swan marsh
O dreari deathtrain
with press lip bloodless
As lip slain
kiss young eyelid
smooth gray hair
let tear quench curs
that burn prayer

strong man prairi
mourn bitter wild
wail desol woman
weep fatherless child
but grain god spring
from ash beneath
and crown hi harvest
Is life death

not vain dial
the shade move along
To point great contrast
Of right wrong
free home free altar
and field ripe food
the reed swan marsh
whose bloom blood

On lintel kansa
that blood shall dri
henceforth bad angel
shall harmless go
henceforth sunset
uncheck way
shall liberti follow
the march day

some linger star seen
when swung gardeng behind us
He fifti fifteen

the hightop chais old gray poni
stood wait lane
idli father sway whiplash
lightli held rein

the star went softli back heaven
the nightfog roll away
and rim gold crown crimson
along hilltop lay

that morn field sure never
So fair aspect wore
and never purpl clover
such perfum rose

oer hill low romant valley
and floweri byroad
sang simplest song familiar
that might sing

our soul lay open pleasur
No shadow came
two children busi leisur
He fifti fifteen



As couch languor lone
weav beguil rhyme
come back strang sweet remembr
that farremov time

the slowpac year brought sad chang

and earth year fifti
