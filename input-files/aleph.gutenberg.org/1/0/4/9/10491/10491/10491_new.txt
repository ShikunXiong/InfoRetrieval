He took soft hand ere mother could bar

So state form love face
that never hall galliard grace
while mother fret father fume
and bridegroom stood dangl bonnet plume
and bridemaiden whisper twere better far
To match fair cousin young lochinvar

Be task god impos thee freak thi pleasur

the green thing grow green thing grow
the faint sweet smell green thing grow
like live whether smile griev
just watch happi life green thing grow

Oh flutter patter green thing grow
how talk none us know
In wonder white weird moonlight
Or dim dreami dawn cock crow

love love green thing grow
and think love without fals show
for mani tender touch comfort much
with soft mute comfort green thing grow

and rich store blossom glow

Oh like see god may

though dust dust return think ll scarc mourn

thi poem taken the poem sidney lanier copyright
publish charl scribner son


If life caught clarionet
and wild heart throb reed
should thrill joy trill fret
and utter heart everi deed

then would breath clarionet
type poet fain would
for none singer ever yet
ha wholli live minstrelsi

Or clearli sung true true thought
Or utterli bodi forth life
Or life song wrought
the perfect one man wife

Or live sung life song
might express
careless life art long
sinc one stand fall

So wonder struck crowd
who shout land
hi song live aloud
hi work sing hand

extract from the ring and the book


our human speech naught
our human testimoni fals fame
and human estim word wind
whi take artist way prove much
becaus glori good art
that art remain one way possibl
Of speak truth mouth like mine least
how look brother face say
thi right wrong eye hast thou yet art blind
thine ear stuf stop despit length
and oh foolish thou countest faith
say silveri tongu troll
the anger man may endur
the shrug disappoint eye
are bad bear plagu
that troubl come tell truth
which truth reach look fals
seem thing would supplant
nor recogniz left
while falsehood would done work truth
but art wherein man nowis speak men
onli mankind art may tell truth
obliqu thing shall breed thought
nor wrong thought miss mediat word
So may paint pictur twice show truth
beyond mere imageri wall
So note note bring music mind
deeper ever adant dive
So write book shall mean beyond fact
suffic eye save soul besid

Of thee hilltop look

farheard low thine ear charm
the sexton toll bell noon

whilst file sweep round yon alpin height
nor knowest thou argument

He sing song cheer

He sang ear sang eye

the delic shell lay shore
the bubbl latest wave
fresh pearl enamel gave
and bellow savag sea
greet safe escap
wipe away weed foam
fetch seaborn treasur home
but poor unsightli noisom thing
had left beauti shore
with sun sand wild uproar

the lover watch grace maid
As mid virgin train stray
nor knew beauti best attir
wa woven still snowwhit choir
At last came hermitag
like bird woodland cage
the gay enchant undon
A gentl wife fairi none

then said covet truth

befor shoreless sea
the good mate said now must pray
for lo star gone
brave admir speak shall say
whi say sail sail

My men grow mutin day
My men grow ghastli pale weak
the stout mate thought home spray
Of salt wave wash swarthi cheek

If sight naught sea dawn
whi shall say break day

they sail sail wind might blow
until last blanch mate said

and peer dark Ah night
Of dark night and speck
A light A light A light A light

It grew time burst dawn
He gain world gave world

IF WE had the time


If time find place
and sit full face face
with better self show
In daili life rush
It might would see soul
wa stumbl still toward shine goal
might nerv thought sublim
If time

If time let heart
speak take life part
To look stretch hand
To comrad quarter noluck land
Ah god If might sit still
and hear note whippoorwil

If time

If time learn

To kiss feet ill
If tear aback cold feign
