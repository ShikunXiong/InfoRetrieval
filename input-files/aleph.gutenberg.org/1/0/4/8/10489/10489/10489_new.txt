what mourner ever felt poetic fire
slow come vers real woe inspir
grief unaffect suit ill art
Or flow number bleed heart

My soul best part ever grave
how silent old companion tread
By midnight lamp mansion dead

and last word dust dust convey d
while speechless oer thi close grave bend
accept tear thou dear depart friend
Oh gone ever take long adieu
and sleep peac next thi lov d montagu
To strew fresh laurel let task mine
A frequent pilgrim thi sacr shrine
mine true sigh thi absenc bemoan
and grave faith epitaph thi stone
If eer thi lov d memori part
may shame afflict alien heart
Of thee forget form song
My lyre broken untun d tongu
My grief doubl thi imag free
and mirth torment unchasti d thee
