the poem


far dearest friend t mine rove
through bare grey dell high wood pastor cove
where derwent rest listen roar
that stun tremul cliff high lodor
where peac grasmer lone island lead
To willowi hedgerow emerald mead
lead bridg rude church cottag ground
her rocki sheepwalk woodland bound
where undisturb wind winand C sleep
mid cluster isl hollysprinkl steep
where twilight glen endear esthwait shore
and memori depart pleasur

fair scene erewhil taught happi child
the echo rock carol wild
the spirit sought cherish sad
A cloudi substitut fail glad
In youth keen eye livelong day bright
the sun morn star night
alik first bittern hollow bill
wa heard woodcock D roam moonlight hill

In thoughtless gaieti cours plain
and hope knew pain
for inexperienc heart would beat
At time young content forsook seat
and wild impati point upward show
through pass yet unreach brighter road
ala idl tale man found
depict dial moral round
hope reflect blend social ray
To gild total tablet day
yet still sport malign power
He know shade present hour

but ungrat dwell idl pain
To show pleasur yet remain
say friend unreluct ear
the histori poet even hear

when south wan noon brood still
breath pale steam around glare hill
and shade deepembattl cloud seen
spot northern cliff light
when crowd cattl check rail make
A fenc far stretch shallow lake
lash cool water restless tail
Or high point rock look fan gale
when schoolboy stretch length upon green
and round broadspread oak glimmer scene
In rough fernclad park herd deer
shook stilltwinkl tail glanc ear
when hors sunburnt intak E stood
and vainli eye tempt flood
Or track passeng mute distress
with forward neck close gate press
then wander huddl rill
brighten waterbreak hollow ghyll F
As enchant obscur retreat
open stay deviou feet
while thick rill branch close
In rocki basin wild wave repos
invert shrub G moss gloomi green
cling rock pale woodwe
and twilight soften whole scene H
save aloft subtl sunbeam shine
On wither briar oer crag reclin
save sparkl foam small cascad
illumin within leafi shade
beyond along vista brook
where antiqu root bustl cours oerlook
the eye repos secret bridg J
half grey half shag ivi ridg
there bend oer stream listless swain
linger behind disappear wain
did sabin grace adorn live line
blandusia prais wild stream yield thine
never shall ruthless minist death
mid thi soft gloom glitter steel unsheath
No goblet shall thee crown flower
No kid piteou outcri thrill thi bower
the mystic shape thi margin rove
A benign sacrific approv
A mind calm angel mood
Of happi wisdom medit good
behold high power requir
much done much design desir
harmoni thought soul truth refin

dear brook farewel tomorrow noon
shall hide woo long thi wildwood strain
but sun gain western road
and eve mild hour invit step abroad

while near midway cliff silver kite
In mani whistl circl wheel flight

By lichen grey scanti moss oergrown
where scarc foxglov peep thistl beard

Of bright obscur hill lawn wood

and insect cloth like dust glassi deep
and everi side surfac break

with thousand thousand twinkl point light

the poem


were spot holi ground
where distress refug might found
and solitud prepar soul heaven
sure natur god spot man given
where fall purpl morn far wide
In flake light upon mountainsid
where loud voic power water shake
the leafi wood sleep quiet lake

yet unrecompens man shall roam
who call summer quit home
and plod wide realm oer vale height
though seek holiday delight
At least own aim
To sage would give prouder name
No gain cheapli earn fanci cloy
though everi pass zephyr whisper joy
brisk toil altern readi eas
feed clear current sympathi
for sodseat cottagedoor adorn
and peep faroff spire even bourn
dear forest frown oer head
and dear velvet greensward tread
move cloud oer midday flame eye
upward look call luxuri E
kind natur chariti step attend
In everi babbl brook find friend
while chasten thought sweetest use bestow
By wisdom moralis pensiv road
host welcom inn noontid bower
To spare meal call pass poor
He view sun uplift golden fire
Or sink heart aliv like memnon lyre F
bless moon come kindli ray
To light shaken rug way
back sight bash children steal
He sit brother cottagem
hi humbl look shi restraint impart
around play virgin heart
while unsuspend wheel villag danc
the maiden eye enquir glanc
much wonder fit craze care
Or desper love bewild came

A hope prudenc could approv
that clung natur truant love
oer gallia wast corn footstep led
her file roadelm high head
In longdrawn vista rustl breez
Or pathway straggl pleas
By lone farm secret villag
but lo alp ascend white air
toy sun glitter afar

and emerg forest gloom
greet thee chartreus mourn thi doom
whither fled power whose frown sever
awe sober reason till crouch fear
that silenc deathlik fetter bound
chain loosen sound
Of holi rite chant measur round

the voic blasphemi fane alarm
the cloister startl gleam arm
the thunder tube age angler hear G
bent oer groan flood sweep away tear
cloudpierc pinetre nod troubl head
spire rock lawn browner night oerspread
strong terror check femal peasant sigh
and start astonish shade femal eye
from bruno forest scream affright jay
and slow insult eagl wheel away
A viewless flight laugh demon mock
the cross angel plant H aerial rock

portent old wood trackless bound
vallombr L mid fall fane deplor
for ever broke sabbath bower

more pleas foot hidden margin rove
Of como bosom deep chestnut grove
No meadow thrown giddi steep
tower bare sylvan narrow deep
To town whose shade rude nois complain
from ring team apart grate wain
To flatroof town touch water bound
Or lurk woodi sunless glen profound
Or bend rock obtrus cling
and oer whiten wave shadow fling
the pathway lead round steep twine
and silenc love purpl roof vine
the loiter travel henc even see
from rockhewn step sail tree
Or mark mid open cliff fair darkey maid

Or stop solemn mountainshad view

and track yellow light steep steep
As oppos hill slowli creep

In golden light half hide shade
while amid darken roof spire

slow glide sail along illumin shore
and steal shade lazi oar
soft bosom breath around contagi sigh

thi glitter steepl whenc matin bell
call forth woodman desert cell
and quicken blith sound oar pass
along steam lake earli mass
but farewel adieu
To everi charm last chief
Ye love maiden noontid shade
rest near littl plot wheaten glade
To bind soul powerless tranc
lipdew song ringlettoss danc
where sparkl eye break smile illum
the sylvan cabin luteenliven gloom
ala murmur stream

while slaveri forc sunk mind dwell
On joy might disgrac captiv cell
her shameless timbrel shake como marg

yet thi softer art power indu
To sooth cheer poor man solitud
By silent cottagedoor peasant home
left vacant day love roam
but pierc maze wood
In cabin undesert stood
there old man olden measur scan
On rude viol touch wither hand
As lamb fawn april cluster lie
under hoari oak thin canopi

hi children children listen sound
A hermit famili around

but let us henc fair locarno smile
embow walnut slope citron isl
Or seek eve bank tusa stream
where mid dim tower wood M water gleam
from bright wave solemn gloom retir
the dullr steep darken still aspir
To afar rich orang lustr glow
round undistinguish cloud rock snow
Or led via mala chasm confin
the indign water infant rhine
hang oer abyss whose els impervi gloom
hi burn eye fear light illum

the mind condemn without repriev go
oer life long desert charg woe
with sad congratul join train
where beast men togeth oer plain
move mighti caravan pain
hope strength courag social suffer bring
freshen wilder shade spring
there whose lot far otherwis cast
sole human tenant pini wast
By choic doom gipsi wander
A nursl babe comfort
Lo sit beneath yon shaggi rock
A cower shape half hid curl smoke

when lightn among cloud mountainsnow

and fierc torrent flash broad
start like hors besid glare road

In roof bridg N bridg dread hour

Or finger count distant clock
Or drowsi crow midnight cock

from green vale urseren smooth wide

Of lowhung vapour freshen mead

while pastor pipe stream landscap lull

To sterner pleasur uri lake
In natur pristin majesti outspread
wind neither road path foot tread

nor stop creation seem end
yet mid savag scene

Up lake zigzag path creep
To reach small woodhut hung boldli steep

No peasant lean upon pole tell
for morn toll funer bell

touch beggar moan human woe

To pilgrim overcom summer heat
yet thither world busi find way
At time tale unsought beguil day
and there fond thought solitud
howev stern powerless exclud
there doth maiden watch lover sail

At midnight listen till part oar

Or hover wast bleak rear

and wildli paus oft hang aghast

Be scorn fear hope alik forgot

On tall peak glisten sunbeam play

stoop gait gain
help staff bore mien air
were hardi though cheek seem worn care
both time come time long fled
down fell straggl lock thin grey hair
A coat wore militari red
but fade stuck oer mani patch shred




while thu journey step step led
He saw pass state inn full sure
that welcom hous none
No board inscrib needi allur
hung bush proclaim old poor
and desol here find friend
the pendent grape glitter door
On must pace perchanc till night descend
where dreari road bare white line extend




the gather cloud grew red stormi fire
In streak diverg wide mount high
that inn long pass distant spire
which oft look back fix eye
wa lost though still look blank sky
perplex comfortless gaze around
and scarc could trace man descri
save cornfield stretch stretch without bound
but sower dwelt nowher found




No tree meadow pleasant green
No brook wet lip sooth ear
long file cornstack seen
but one dwellingplac heart cheer
some labour thought may perchanc near
and sent feebl shout vain
No voic made answer could hear
wind rustl plot unrip grain
Or whistl thro thin grass along unfurrow plain




long fanci success slope
conceal cottag whither might turn
and rest along heaven darken cope
the crow rush eddi homeward born
thu warn sought shepherd spread thorn
Or hovel storm shield head
but sought vain wild forlorn
and vacant huge wast around spread
the wet cold ground fear must bed




and chill night shower
and sharp wind head oft hath bare
A sailor mani wretch hour
hath told land labour hard
full long endur hope reward
He arm fleet forc away
By seamen perhap share
like fate hurri helpless prey
gainst his heart perhap said nay




for year work carnag ceas
and death dire aspect daili survey
death minist came glad releas
and hope return pleasur fondli made
her dwell dream By fanci aid
the happi husband fli arm throw
round wife neck prize victori laid
In full lap see sweet tear flow
As thenceforth pain troubl could know




vain hope fraud took earn
the lion roar glut tawni brood
even desert heart return
bear love need food
hi home approach mood
that sight children might run
He met travel rob shed blood
and miser work done
He fled vagrant sinc murder fate shun


IX

from day forth place could
So lone thenc might come pang
brought without inward miseri
now plod sullen clang
A sound chain along desert rang
He look saw upon gibbet high
A human bodi iron swang
uplift tempest whirl
and hover round often raven fli C




It spectacl none might view
In spot savag shudder pain

all fear man rous train
Of mind phantom horribl vain

He fell without sens motion lay
but tranc gone feebli pursu way

the poem


there thorn look old
In truth d find hard say
how could ever young
It look old grey
not higher two year child
It stand erect age thorn
No leav prickli point
It mass knot joint
A wretch thing forlorn
It stand erect like stone
with lichen overgrown


like rock stone oergrown
with lichen top
and hung heavi tuft moss
A melancholi crop
Up earth moss creep
and poor thorn clasp round
So close d say bent
with plain manifest intent
To drag ground
and join one endeavour
To buri poor thorn ever


high mountain highest ridg
where oft stormi winter gale
cut like scyth cloud
It sweep vale vale
not five yard mountain path
thi thorn left espi
and left three yard beyond
you see littl muddi pond
Of water never dri
though compass small bare
To thirsti sun parch air A


and close besid age thorn
there fresh love sight
A beauteou heap hill moss
just half foot height
all love colour see
all colour ever seen
and mossi network
As hand ladi fair
the work woven
and cup darl eye
So deep vermilion dye


Ah love tint
Of oliv green scarlet bright
In spike branch star
green red pearli white
thi heap earth oergrown moss
which close besid thorn see
So fresh beauteou dye
Is like infant grave size
As like like
but never never
An infant grave half fair


now would see age thorn
thi pond beauteou hill moss
you must take care choos time
the mountain cross
for oft sit heap
So like infant grave size
and pond spoke
A woman scarlet cloak
and cri
oh miseri oh miseri
Oh woe oh miseri


At time day night
thi wretch woman thither goe
and known everi star
and everi wind blow
and besid thorn sit
when blue daylight sky
and whirlwind hill
Or frosti air keen still
and cri
oh miseri oh miseri
Oh woe oh miseri


now wherefor thu day night
In rain tempest snow
thu dreari mountaintop
doe poor woman go
and sit besid thorn
when blue daylight sky
Or whirlwind hill
Or frosti air keen still
and wherefor cri
O wherefor wherefor tell
doe repeat dole cri


IX tell wish could
for true reason one know
but would gladli view spot
the spot goe
the hillock like infant grave
the pond thorn old grey
pass door t seldom shut
and see hut
then spot away
never heard dare
approach spot


but wherefor mountaintop
can unhappi woman go
whatev star sky
whatev wind may blow
full twenti year past gone
sinc name martha ray
gave maiden true goodwil
her compani stephen hill
and blith gay
while friend kindr approv
Of tenderli love


XI and fix wed day
the morn must wed
but stephen anoth maid
had sworn anoth oath
and maid church
unthink stephen went
poor martha woeful day
A pang pitiless dismay
into soul sent
A fire kindl breast
which might burn rest


xii they say full six month
while yet summer leav green
she mountaintop would go
and often seen
what could seek wish hide
her state eye plain
she child mad
yet often sober sad
from exceed pain
O guilti father would death
had save breach faith


xiii sad case brain hold
communion stir child
sad case may think one
who brain wild
last christmasev talk
and greyhair wilfr glen
held unborn infant wrought
about mother heart brought
her sens back
and last time drew near
her look calm sens clear


xiv more know wish
and told
for becam poor child
No mortal ever knew
nay child born
No earthli tongu could ever tell
and t born aliv dead
far less could proof said
but rememb well
that martha ray time
would mountain often climb


XV and winter night
the wind blew mountainpeak
T worth though dark
the churchyard path seek
for mani time oft heard
cri come mountain head
some plainli live voic
and other ve heard mani swear
were voic dead
think whate say
they martha ray


xvi but goe old thorn
the thorn describ
and sit scarlet cloak
sworn true
for one day telescop
To view ocean wide bright
when countri first came
ere heard martha name
climb mountain height
A storm came could see
No object higher knee


xvii T mist rain storm rain
No screen fenc could discov
and wind sooth
A wind full ten time
look around thought saw
A jut crag ran
headforemost drive rain
the shelter crag gain
and man
instead jut crag found
A woman seat ground


xviii speak saw face
her face enough
turn heard cri
oh miseri oh miseri
and sit moon
through half clear blue sky go
and littl breez make
the water pond shake
As countri know
she shudder hear cri
oh miseri oh miseri


xix but thorn pond
and hill moss
and creep breez come
the littl pond stir
tell say
she hang babi tree
some say drown pond
which littl step beyond
but agre

beneath hill moss fair


XX ve heard moss spot red
with drop poor infant blood
but kill newborn infant thu
think could
some say pond go
and fix steadi view
the shadow babe trace
A babi babi face
and look
whene look t plain
the babi look


xxi and sworn oath
should public justic brought
and littl infant bone
with spade would sought
but instantli hill moss
befor eye began stir
and full fifti yard around
the grass shook upon ground
yet still aver
the littl babe lie buri
beneath hill moss fair


xxii tell may
but plain thorn bound
with heavi tuft moss strive
To drag ground
and know full mani time
when mountain high
By day silent night
when star shone clear bright
that heard cri
oh miseri oh miseri
Oh woe oh miseri

Oh let bodi die away

In rustl conflict sky

and yet upon eye

Oh let bodi die away


My fire dead knew pain
yet dead remain
all stiff ice ash lie
and dead die
when well wish live
for cloth warmth food fire
but joy give
No pleasur desir
then content lie
alon fear die

A woman thi mother

On strang look

As strove man
that might pull sledg
and stretch arm wild
Oh merci like helpless child


My littl joy littl pride
In two day must die
then weep griev
feel must die thee
O wind oer head art fli
the way friend cours bend
feel pain die
could thee messag send
too soon friend ye went away
for mani thing say

ll follow across snow
Ye travel heavili slow
In spite weari pain
ll look upon tent
My fire dead snowi white
the water besid stood
the wolf come tonight
and stolen away food
for ever left alon
then wherefor fear die

young cours run
shall see anoth sun
lift limb know
If life
My poor forsaken child
for could thee close
with happi heart would die
and last thought would happi
but thou dear babe art far away
nor shall see anoth day

In distant countri
and yet often seen
A healthi man man full grown
weep public road alon
but one english ground
and broad highway met
along broad highway came
hi cheek tear wet
sturdi seem though sad
and arm lamb


He saw turn asid
As wish hide

To wipe brini tear away

when young singl man
and youth folli ran
though littl given care thought

and sheep rais
As healthi sheep might see
and marri rich
As could wish
Of sheep number full score
and everi year increas store


year year stock grew
and one singl ewe
full fifti come sheep rais
As fine flock ever graze
upon quantock hill fed
they throve home thrive
thi lusti lamb store
Is aliv

and perish poverti


six children sir feed
hard labour time need
My pride tame grief
parish ask relief
they said wealthi man
My sheep upon upland fed
and fit thenc took
whereof buy us bread
do give
they cri what poor due


sold sheep said
and bought littl children bread
and healthi food
for never good
A woeful time
To see end gain
the pretti flock rear
with care pain
To see melt like snow away
for woeful day


anoth still still anoth
A littl lamb mother
It vein never stop
like blooddrop heart drop
till thirti left aliv
they dwindl dwindl one one
and may say mani time
wish gone
reckless might come last

So moonlight lane go
and far moonlight dale

To bring doctor town
To comfort poor old susan gale

and betti susan side

Of johnni wit johnni glori

and betti droop heart

and susan grow wors wors
and betti sad quandary
and nobodi say
If must go must stay

but neither doctor guid

there neither hors man abroad
and betti still susan side

and susan begin fear
Of sad mischanc
that johnni may perhap drown
Or lost perhap never found
which must ever rue

she prefac half hint

If hurt life limb
Oh god forbid poor susan cri

what say betti go

then hie prayer
that god poor susan life would spare

and cross bridg came
A thought heart sore
johnni perhap hors forsook
To hunt moon within brook

now high upon
alon amid prospect wide
there neither johnni hors

Oh saint becom

Or sadli misl

Or wick poni carri
To dark cave goblin hall
Or castl pursu

Or play waterfal

At poor old susan rail
while town post away
If susan ill

To lay hand upon star

No doubt moon seen
