someth wrong gloria drop fire
slump forward lay face upon cross arm He could see
frail bodi shake could hear sudden wild sob

the truth came upon last dawn slowli slowli

gloria It gasp amaz constern
heart gloria

she lift head sat He saw great wideopen eye
tear gush she fought control sob
throat she rose came toward strang wildli uncertain step

gloria you

Sh mark must nt

but could nt lie still He lift upon elbow look
wonder eye she stood look verg
collaps slowli came half kneel half fall

My god cri hoars you went bear you it

she tri smile eye broke sudden
gush tear

you wonder wonder wonder gloria cri there
girl world could done girl like

her hand quest caught grip
strength hurt last pain smile
broke

gloria

mark

can soon day forgiv

she found faint whisper answer eye
hungri

can forgiv mark

and eye clung togeth hand alreadi
cling marvel could forgiv love one
