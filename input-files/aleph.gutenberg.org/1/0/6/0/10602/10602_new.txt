the ruin OF time


It chaunc on day besid shore
Of silver stream thamesi bee
nigh goodli verlam stood yore
Of remain memori
nor ani littl moniment see
By travail fare way
thi she may warn say
on one

there side behold
A woman sit sorrowfulli wail
rend yeolow lock like wyri gold
about shoulder carelesli down trail
and stream tear fair eye forth railing
In right hand broken rod held
which toward heaven shee seemd high weld
railing flow

whether one river nymph
which loss dere love lament
doubt one three fatal imp
which draw day men forth extent
Or thauncient geniu citi brent
but see piteousli perplex
call askt vex
brent burnt

Ah delight quoth earthli thing
Or comfort wretch creatur
whose happin heaven envi
from highest stair lowest step drave
and mine own bowel made grave
that nation forlorne
the world sad spectacl fortun scorn
forlorne forsaken

much moov piteou plaint
and felt heart nigh riven brest
with tender ruth see sore constraint
that shed tear still rest
and name request
name none quoth ani
bereft fate uniust decre

citi garland wore
Of britain pride deliv unto
By roman victor wonn yore
though nought ruin bee
and lye mine own ash ye see
verlam boot
sith weed wastful gra

O vain world glori unstedfast state
Of live face sinful earth
which first until utmost date
tast one hower happin merth
but like ingate berth
they cri creep mother woomb
So wail back go woful toomb
ingate entranc begin

whi dooth flesh bubblegla breath
hunt honour advaunc vain
and rear trophe devour death
with great labour longlast pain
As dai ever remain
sith world great gaie
doth vapour vanish decai

look back list unto former age
and call count becom
where learn wit antiqu sage
which wisedom knew perfect somm
where great warrior overcom
the world conquest might main
and made one meare thearth rain
meare boundari

what now thassyrian lyoness
Of whome foot earth appear
what persian bear outragiousness
whose memori quit worn year
who grecian libbard ought hear
that overran east greedi powr
and left whelp kingdom devour
libbard leopard

and great sevenhead beast
that made nation vassal pride
To fall feet beheast
and neck world ride
where doth wondrou welth now hide
with weight down press shee lie
and heap hugeness testifi

O rome thi ruin lament rue
and thi fall fatal overthrow
that whilom whilst heaven equal vew
deignd behold gift bestow
the pictur thi pride pompou shew
and whole world thou wast empress
So small northern world princess

To tell beawti build fayr
adornd purest gold preciou stone
To tell rich endow rare
that foe spent gone
To tell forc matchabl none
were lost labour would beleev
and rehears would agreev

high tower fair templ goodli theater
strong wall rich porch princeli pallac
larg street brave hous sacr sepulch
sure gate sweet garden state galleri
wrought fair pillour fine imageri
all O piti turnd dust
and overgrowen black oblivion rust

theretoo warlik power peopl store
In britanni none match mee
that mani often abi full sore
Ne troynovant though elder sister shee
with great forc might compar bee
that stout pendragon peril felt
who sieg seaven yere dwelt
troynovant london

but long ere bunduca britonness
her mighti hoast bulwark brought
bunduca victori conqueress
that lift brave heroick thought
bove women weakn roman fought
fought field thrice prevail
yet foyld assail

and though last forc conquer
Of hardi saxon becam thrall
yet much bloodsh bought full deer
and prizd slaughter general
the moniment whose sad funeral
for wonder world long last
but nought spoyl time wast

wast never
and rest honord made
and world admir evri
Is turnd smoak doth noth fade
and brightn appear shade
but greisli shade doo haunt hell
with fearful fiend deep darkn dwell

where high steepl whilom usd stand
On lordli faulcon wont towr
there heap lyme sand
for shricheowl build baleful bowr
and nightingal wont forth powr
her restl plaint comfort wakeful lover
there haunt yell mew whine plover

and christal thami wont slide
In silver channel down along lee
about whose flowri bank either side
A thousand nymph mirthful iollite
were wont play annoy free
there river cours seen
but moorish fenn marsh ever green

seem gentl river great grief
Of mishap oft plain
Or shunn horribl mischief
with saw cruell foe pain
and pure stream guiltl blood oft stain
from unhappi neighborhood farr fled
and sweet water away led

there also wing ship seen
In liquid wave cut fomi waie
and thousand fisher numbr
In wide lake look plenteou praie
Of fish bait usd betrai
Is lake ani fisher store
nor ever ship shall sail ani

they gone gone
Ne ought remain lament
My long decay man el doth mone
and mourn fall doleful dreriment
yet comfort great languish
To bemon compass kind
and mitig anguish mind

but man bewaileth game
Ne sheddeth tear lament eie
nor ani live mentioneth name
To remembr posteriti
save one maugr fortun iniuri
and time decay envi cruell tort
hath writ record trueseem sort
tort wrong

cambden nourice antiquiti
and lantern unto late succed age
To see light simpl veriti
buri ruin great outrag
Of own peopl led warlik rage
cambden though time moniment obscur
yet thi iust labour ever shall endur
nourice nurs

but whie unhappi wight doo thu crie
and griev remembr quit raced
out knowledg posteriti
and antiqu moniment defac
sith doo daili see thing highest place
So soon fate vital thred shorn
forgotten quit never born
raced raze

It long sinc two eye beheld
A mighti prince renowm race
whom england high count honour held
and greatest one sue game grace
Of greatest one greatest place
sate bosom soverain
and right loyall word maintain
I e earl leicest
leicest motto

saw die saw die one
Of mean peopl brought foorth bear
saw die man left mone
hi doleful fate late love dear
scars ani left close eylid near
scars ani left upon lip laie
the sacr sod requiem saie

O trustless state miser men
that build bli hope earthli thing
and vainli think selv half happi
when paint face smooth flatter
doo fawn wide prais sing
and court masker louteth low
him true heart trusti trow
louteth boweth

all fain oaker dide
that everi shower wash wipe away
all thing doo chang heaven abid
and death friendship doth decai
therefor ever man bearst worldli sway
live god thi self reli
for thou diest shall thee die
oaker ochr paint

He dead dead
save heaven storehous uplaid
hi hope faild come pass dread
and evil men dead deed upbraid
spite bite dead live never baid
He gone while fox crept
into hole badger swept

He dead glori gone
and greatn vapour nought
that glass upon water shone
which vanisht quit soon sought
hi name worn alreadi thought
Ne ani poet seek reviv
yet mani poet honourd aliv

Ne doth colin careless colin clout
care idl bagpip rais
Ne tell sorrow listn rout
Of shepherd groom wont song prais
prais list yet disprais
until quite guilti blame
wake shepheard boy length awak shame
quite acquit

and el goodn game
and el bounteou mind trie
whether shepheard shepheard swain
for mani doo deni
awak song part appli
and whilest mourn deceas
will mourn plaint plaint increas
trie experi

He dyde brother dyde
hi brother princ brother nobl peer
that whilst live none envyd
and dead live count dear
dear unto true affect bear
but unto thee dear O dearest dame
hi nobl spous paragon fame

He whilest live happi thee
and dead happi much
live linck chaunst thee bee
and dead dead thou dost ador
As live thi lost dear love deplor
So whilst thou fair flower chastiti
dost live thee thi lord shall never die

thi lord shall never die while vers
shall live sure shall live ever
for ever shall live shall rehears
hi worthi prais vertu die never
though death soul doo bodi sever
and thou thi self herein shalt also live
such grace heaven doo vers give

Ne shall sister ne thi father die
thi father good earl rare renown
and nobl patron weak poverti
whose great good deed countrey town
have purchast heaven happi crown
where liveth eternal bli
and left sonn tensu step

He nobl bud grandsir liveli hayr
under shadow thi countenaunc
now ginn shoot fast flourish fayr
In learn art goodli governaunc
that highest honour shall advaunc
brave impe bedford grow apac bounti
and count wisedom thi counti

Ne may let thi husband sister die
that goodli ladi sith eke spring
out stock famou famili
whose prais futur age doo sing
and foorth happi womb bring
the sacr brood learn honour
In heaven powrd gift upon

most gentl spirit breath
out bosom maker bli
In bounti vertuou love
appear nativ properti
and enrich nobl breast
with treasur pass world worth
worthi heaven self brought forth

hi bless spirit full power divin
and influenc celestial grace
loath sinful earth earthli slime
fled back soonc unto nativ place
too soon love embrac
too soon wretch world
robd right true nobiliti

yet ere happi soul heaven went
out fleshli goal devis
unto heavenli maker present
hi bodi spotl sacrifis
and chose guilti hand enemi
should powr forth thoffr guiltl blood
So life exchang countri good

O nobl spirit live ever bless
the world late wonder heaven new ioy
live ever leav distress
with mortal care cumbrou world anoy
but thou dost happin enioy
bid O bid quickli come thee
that happi maie thee alwai see

yet whilest fate affoord vital breath
spend speak thi prais
and sing thee until timeli death
By heaven doom doo end earthli dai
thereto doo thou humbl spirit rais
and sacr breath inspir
which thou breathest perfect entir

then sing better sing
than thine own sister peerl ladi bright
which thee sing deep hart sorrow
sorrow temper dear delight
that hear feel feebl spright
rob sens ravish ioy
O sad ioy made mourn anoy

yet sing better sing
than thou thyself thine own self valianc
that whilest thou livedst madest forrest ring
and field resownd flock leap daunc
and shepheard leav lamb unto mischaunc
To runn thi shrill arcadian pipe hear
O happi day thrice happi

but happi thou wretch wee
which want wont sweetn thi voic
while thou elisian field free
with orpheu linu choic
Of ever rime reioyc
conversest doost hear heavenli lay
and hear thine thine doo better prais

So thou livest sing evermor
and thou livest ever song
Of us live love thee afor
and thee worship mongst bless throng
Of heavenli poet hero strong
So thou immortal art
and everi excel desart

but neither sing
nor yet sung other reward
die obscur oblivion thing
which never ne ever regard
their name shall later age heard
but shall rustic darkn ever lie
unl mentiond infami

what booteth rich aliv
what great graciou
when death token doth surviv
Of former mortal hou
but sleep dust dead inglori
like beast whose breath nostrel
and hath hope happiness bli

how mani great one may remembr
which dai famousli florish
Of whome word hear sign see
but thing wipt spong perish
becaus live care cherish
No gentl wit pride covet
which might name ever memor

provid therefor ye princ whilst ye live
that muse ye may friend bee
which unto men eterniti give
for daughter dame memori
and love father eterniti
and men golden throne repos
whose merit glorifi chose

the sevenfold yron gate grisli hell
and horrid hous sad proserpina
they abl power mighti spell
To break thenc soul bring awai
out dread darkeness eternal day
and immortal make el would die
In foul forgetfulness namel lie

So whilom rais puissant brood
Of goldengirt alcmena great merit
out dust oetaean wood
had consum d spent vital spirit
To highest heaven doth inherit
all happiness hebe silver bowr
chosen dearest paramour

So raisd eke fair leda warlick twinn
and interchang life unto lent
that thone die thother beginn
To shew heaven brightn orient
and pitti sad wayment
which orpheu eurydic make
her back again life sent sake
wayment lament

So happi fortun
whom pierian sacr sister love
that freed band impacable fate
and power death live aye
where mortal wreak bli may remov
but god former veriti meed
On nectar ambrosia feed
impacable unappeas

for deed doe die ever nobli donn
and thought men decay
but wise word taught number runn
record muse live ay
Ne may storm shower washt away
Ne bitterbreath wind harmful blast
nor age envi shall ever wast

In vain doo earthli princ vain
seek pyramid heaven aspir
Or huge coloss built costli pain
Or brasen pillour never fire
Or shrine made mettal desir
To make memori ever live
for mortal immortaliti give

such one mausolu made world great wonder
but remnant doth thereof remain
such one marcellu torn thunder
such one lisippu worn rain
such one king edmond rent gain
all vain moniment earthli mass
devour d time time nought doo pass

but fame golden wing aloft doth flie
abov reach ruinou decay
and brave plume doth beat azur skie
admir d baseborn men farr away
then vertuou deed assay
To mount heaven pegasu must ride
and sweet poet vers glorifid

for dipt leth lake
could save sonn theti die
but blind bard immortal make
with vers dipt deaw castali
which made eastern conquerour crie
O fortun yong man whose vertu found
So brave tromp thi nobl act sound

therefor half happi doo read
good meliba hath poet got
To sing live prais dead
deserv never forgot
In spight envi deed would spot
sinc whose deceas learn lie unregard
and men arm doo wander unreward
read consid

those two two great calam
that long ago griev nobl spright
Of salomon great indign
who whilom aliv wisest wight
but wisedom disproov quit
for welds thing
scorn thone thother deeper skill
welds wield

O grief grief O gall good heart
To see vertu dispis bee
Of first raisd vertuou part
and broad spread like age tree
let none shoot nigh plant bee
O let man muse scorn
nor aliv dead muse adorn

O vile world trust vain illus
hath wise men bewitcht overkest
that see way confus
O vainess ad rest
that soul inward grief infest
let behold piteou fall mee
and case own ensampl see
overkest overcast

and el sit highest seat
Of world glori worship
Ne feareth chang time fortun threat
let behold horror fall
and own end unto remembr call
that like ruin may warn bee
and himself moov d pitti mee

thu end piteou plaint
with doleful shrike shee vanish away
that inward sorrow wexen faint
and astonish deep dismay
for departur word say
but sate long time senceless sad affright
look still might sight

which miss look long
My thought return greev home again
renew complaint passion strong
for ruth woman piteou pain
whose word record troubl brain
felt anguish wound feebl heart
that frosen horror ran everi part

So inli greev grone brest
and deepeli muze doubtful speach
whose mean much labor foorth wrest
be slender reason reach
At length demonstr teach
befor mine eie strang sight present
like tragick pageant seem appear




saw imag massi gold
place high upon altar fair
that farr behold
might worship fall lowest stair
not great idol might compair
To thassyrian tyrant would made
the holi brethren falsli praid

but thaltar imag staid
wa O great piti built brickle clay
that shortli foundat decaid
with showr heaven tempest worn away
then down fell low ash lay
scorn everi one went
that se deareli lament
brickle brittl



next unto stateli towr appear
built richest stone might bee found
and nigh unto heaven height uprear
but place plot sandi ground
not great towr much renownd
for tongu confus holi writ
king ninu work might compar d

but O vain labour terrestrial wit
that build strongli frayl soyl
As storm fall away flit
and give fruit travail toyl
To pray tyme fortun spoyl
saw towr fall sodainli dust
that nigh grief thereof heart brust



then see pleasant parad
full sweet flowr daintiest delight
such earth man could deviz
with pleasur choyc feed cheer spright
not merlin magick slight
made gentl squir entertain
hi fayr belphoeb could gardin stain

but O short pleasur bought last pain
whi hereaft ani flesh delight
In earthli bli ioy pleasur vain
sinc saw gardin wast quit
that scarc seem ani sight
that beauti behold
could tear melt eye withhold



soon giaunt came place
Of wondrou power exceed statur
that none durst vew horror face
yet mild speach meek natur
not despight creatour
with rail tearm defi iewish hoast
might mighti one hugen boast

for one could thother coast
stretch strong thigh thocean overstrid
and reatch hand enemi hoast
but see end pomp fleshli pride
one feet unwar slide
that down hee fell deep abiss
where drownd earthli bliss



then see bridg made gold
over sea one side
withouten prop pillour tuphold
but like colour rainbow arch wide
not great arch traian edifid
To wonder age ensu
wa matchabl equal vew

but ah boot see earthli thing
In glori greatn excel
sith time doth greatest thing ruin bring
thi goodli bridg one foot fastn well
gan fail rest down shortli fell
Ne brave build ought remain
that grief thereof spirit greatli pain


saw two bear white ani milk
ly togeth mighti cave
Of mild aspect hair soft silk
that salvag natur seem
nor greedi spoyl blood crave
two fairer beast might elswher found
although compast world sought around
compast round

but long abid ground
In state bli stedfast happiness
the cave bear lay sleep sound
wa earth own weightiness
upon fell unwar oppress
that great sorrow sudden fate
henceforth world feliciti hate

much troubl heavi spright
At sight sad spectacl forepast
that sens bereav quight
and mind remain sore agast
distraught twixt fear piti last
heard voyc loudli call
that suddein shrill appal

behold said ensampl see
that vaniti grief mind
Ne comfort world
but hope heaven heart god inclind
for rest must need left behind
with bad side
To cast mine eye sight spide



upon famou river shore
there stood snowi swan heavenli hiew
and gentl kind ever fowl afor
A fairer one goodli criew
Of white strimonian brood might man view
there sweetli sung propheci
Of own death doleful elegi

At last mourn melodi
He end shore resound
feel fit forewarnd die
with lofti flight earth bound
and sight highest heaven mount
where becom heavenli sign
there ioy sorrow mine



whilest thu look loe adown lee
saw harp stroong silver twyne
and made gold costli yvori
swim whilom seem
the harp dan orpheu seen
wyld beast forrest lead
but thharp philisides dead
lee surfac stream
philisides sir philip sidney

At length river reard
and born cloud divin d
whilst way heavenli noys heard
Of string stir warbl wind
that wrought ioy sorrow mind
So heaven sign doth appear
the harp well known besid northern bear



soon saw thother side
A curiou coffer made heben wood
that preciou treasur hide
exceed baser world good
yet overflow flood
It almost drown done nought
that sight thereof much griev d pensiv thought
heben eboni

At length peril brought
two angel down descend swift flight
out swell stream lightli caught
and twixt bless arm carri quight
abov reach ani live sight
So transform d starr
In heavenli treasur lock



look asid saw state bed
adorn costli cloth gold
that might ani princ couch red
and deckt dainti flowr shold
Be bride ioyou night hold
therein goodli virgin sleep lay
A fairer wight saw never summer day
red taken

heard voyc call farr away
and awak bad quickli dight
for lo bridegrom readi ray
To come seek love delight
with start chereful sight
when suddeinli bed gone
and languor left alon



still gaze beheld stood
A knight arm d upon wing steed
the bred medusa blood
On dan perseu born heavenli seed
the fair andromeda peril freed
full mortal knight ywound
that stream blood foorth flow gra

yet deckt small ioy ala
with mani garland victori
and rich spoyl late purcha
through brave atcheiv enemi
faint last long infirm
He smote steed straight heaven bore
and left loss deplor



lastli saw ark purest gold
upon brazen pillour stand hie
which thash seem d great princ hold
enclosd therein endl memori
Of world glorifi
seem heaven earth disagre

At last seem d wingfoot mercuri
from heaven descend appeas strife
the ark bear skie
and ash gave second life
To live heaven happin rife
At earth griev exceedingli
and dole almost like die

immortal spirit philisid
which art made heaven ornament
that whilom wast world chiefst rich
give leav lovd thee lament

the tear OF the muse


rehears ye sacr sister nine
the golden brood great apollo wit
those piteou plaint sorowful sad tine
which late ye powr forth ye sit
besid silver spring helicon
make musick hartbreak mone

for sinc time phoebu foolish sonn
ythunder love avengeful wrath
for travers charret sunn
beyond compass point path
Of mournful sister lament
such mournful tune never sinc invent

nor sinc fair calliop lose
her love twinn dearl ioy
her palici unkindli foe
the fatal sister spight destroy
whom muse bewail long space
wa ever heard wayl place

for grove heavenli noys
Of sweet instrument wont sound
and thhollow hill silver voyc
were wont redoubl echo rebound
did rebound nought ruful cri
and yell shriek thrown sky

the trembl stream wont chanel clear
To rombl gentli down murmur soft
and right tuneful taught bear
A base part amongst consort oft
now forst overflow brackish tear
with troublou noys dull dainti ear

the ioyou nymph lightfoot faeri
which thether came hear musick sweet
and measur melodi
did learn move nimbleshift feet
now hear heavili lament
like heavili lament went

and el wont work delight

Of one ween wofulst man aliv

ie sir arthur gorg

but whoso els pleasur findeth sens
Or wretch life doeth take delight
let banisht farr away henc
Ne let sacr sister hight
though sorrow heavili sing
for even heavi song would breed delight
but tune save sob grone shall ring
hight summon

In stead sweet harmoni
let three fatal sister whose sad hand
doe weav direful threed destini
and wrath break vital band
approach hereto let dreadful queen
Of darkn deep come stygian strand
and grisli ghost hear doleful teene
teene sorrow

In gloomi even weari sun
after day long labour drew rest
and sweati steed overrun
the compast skie gan water west
walkt abroad breath fresh ayr
In open field whose flowr pride opprest
with earli frost lost beauti fair

there came unto mind troublou thought
which dayli doth weaker wit possess
Ne let rest until forth brought
her long born infant fruit heaviness
which conceiv hath medit
Of world vainness life wretchedness
that yet soul deep doth empassion
empassion move

So muze miseri

then turn back said hollow sound
who dooth name woful thrall

one like wofulness impress deep
hath made fit mate thi wretch case hear
and given like caus thee wail wepe
grief find eas like bear
then stay alcyon gentl shepheard stay
quoth till thou trusti ear
commit thee dooth ill apay
ill apay  discont distress

ceas foolish man said half wroth
To seek hear told
for huge anguish doeth multipli
My die pain tongu well unfold
Ne doo care bemon
My hard mishap weep would
but seek alon weep dye alon

then quoth thou bent
To die alon unpiti unplain
yet ere thou die conveni
To tell caus thee thereto constrain
least world thee dead accus guilt
and say thou none shall maintain
that thou secret crime thi blood hast spilt

who life loath long unbound
from strong shackl frail flesh quoth
nought care live ground
deem occas death bee
rather desir forgotten quight
than question made calamiti
for hart deep sorrow hate life light

yet sinc much thou seemst rue grief
and carst one himself care nought
sign thi love though nought relief
for relief exceedeth live thought

then harken well till end brought
for never didst thou hear hapless fate

reposedst hope weenedst her thi frend
that glori mortal miseri
and dayli doth changeful counsel bend
To make new matter fit tragedi

for whilest thu without dread dout
A cruel satyr murdrou dart

My lyoness ah woe gon

therewith gan afresh wail weep
that pitti heavi plight

but saw anguish spright
some deal alaid bespak again
cert alcyon painful thi plight
that breed almost equal pain

yet doth dull wit well understand
the riddl thi love lioness
for rare seem reason skand
that man doth whole world rule possess

In stead tear whose brackish bitter well

To think ground fair blossom fell

yet fell one enforst dye
Ne dyde dread grudg discont

So lay down sleep went

Ne ever shepheard sound oaten quill
unto many provok might
To idl pleasanc let ghastliness
and dreari horror dim chearful light
To make imag true heaviness
many compani

let bird silent nake spray
and shadi wood resound dreadful yell
let stream flood hasti cours stay
and parch drouth drie cristal well
let thearth barren bring foorth flowr
and thayr fild noys doleful knell
and wandr spirit walk untim howr

and natur nurs everi live thing
let rest self long weariness
and ceas henceforth thing kindli forth bring
but hideou monster full ugliness
for hath done wrong
No nurs stepdam cruell merciless
weep shepheard weep make undersong





My littl flock earst lov d well
and wont feed finest grass grew
feed ye hencefoorth bitter astrofell
and stink smallag unsaveri rew
and maw weed corrupt
Be ye pray wolv ne rew
that carkass wild beast glut
astrofell probabl starwort see astrophel

Ne wors silli sheep pray
Ne sorer vengeanc wish fall
than self whose confusd decay
To careless heaven doo dayli call
but heaven refus hear wretch cri
and cruell death doth scorn come call
Or graunt boon desir dye
decay destruct

the good righteou away doth take
To plagu thunright aliv remain
but ungodli one doth forsak
By live long multipli pain
els sure death punish
As great iudg first ordain
but rather riddanc long languish

therefor daphn tane away
for worthi better place
but unworthi will stay
that lack might torment
sith ordr pay
penanc according decre
and ghost doe servic day day
according accord

for walk wandr pilgrimag
throughout world one end
and afflict wast better age
My bread shall anguish mynd
My drink tear fro mine eye rain
My bed ground hardest may fynd
So wil increas pain

and love saint
when behold celestial throne
In shee ioyeth eternal bli
My bitter penanc case bemon
and pitti live thu doo die
for heavenli spirit compass
On mortal men rue miseri

So sorrow satisfyd
thimportun fate vengeanc seek
and thheaven long languor pacifyd
she pure piti suffer meek
will send daili long
and till painful penanc eek
weep shepheard weep make undersong




hencefoorth hate whatev natur made
and workmanship pleasur find
for vain quickli fade
So soon blow northern wind
they tarri flit fall away
leav behind nought grief mind
and mock think long stay

hate heaven doth withhould
Me love eke love
hate earth mould
Of fleshli slime frail mortaliti
hate fire nought flye
hate ayr sigh
hate sea tear supply

hate day lendeth light
To see thing love see
hate darkness dreari night
becaus breed sad balefulness mee
hate time time doo fli
So fast away may stay bee
but speedi post passeth

hate speak voyc spent cri
hate hear lowd plaint duld mine ear
hate tast food withhold die
hate see mine eye dimd tear
hate smell sweet earth left
hate feel flesh numbd fear
So sens bereft

hate men shun womankind
the one wretch
the doo find
My love wont starr
and life hate last
and death hate life doth marr
and hate come past

So world hate
becaus changeth ever fro
and never standeth one certain state
but still unstedfast round doth goe
like millwheel midst miseri
driven stream wretchedness woe
that die live live still dye

So doo live doo dayli die
and pine away selfeconsum pain
sith vital powr suppli
and feebl spirit forc maintain
Is fetcht fro seek prolong
My weari dai dolour disdaln
weep shepheard weep make undersong




whi doo longer live life despight
and doo dye despight death
whi doo longer see loathsom light
and doo darkness abridg breath
sith sorrow end therebi
and care find quiet Is uneath
To leav life dolor dye
uneath difficult

To live find deadli dolor
for life draw care care continual woe
therefor dye must need ioyeou
and wishful thing sad life forgo
but must stay may amend
My daphn henc depart bad
she bad stay till send

yet whilest wretch vale doo stay
My weari feet shall ever wandr
that still may readi way
when messeng doth come
Ne rest feet feebleness
Ne rest limm frailti
Ne rest mine eye heaviness

but mother god sought
for fair euridyc daughter dere
throughout world woful heavi thought
So travel whilest tarri heer
Ne lodg ne ever lin
Ne droup titan draweth nere
To loos teem take inne
lin ceas
inne lodg

Ne sleep harbenger weari wight
shall ever lodg upon mine eyelid
Ne shall rest refresh faint spright
nor fail forc former strength restor
but wake sorrow night
with philumene fortun deplor
with philumen partner plight
harbenger one provid lodg repos
philumene philomel


and ever see starr fall
and ground goe give light
which dwell darkness mind call
how fair starr shind bright
fell sodainli fade ground
sinc whose departur day turnd night
and night without venu starr found

but soon day doth shew deawi face
and cal foorth men unto toylsom trade
withdraw darkesom place
Or dere cave solitari shade
there sigh sorrow day long
and huge burden care unlad
weep shepheard weep make undersong
Qu derne lone Or drere





henceforth mine eye shall never behold
fair thing earth ne feed fals delight
Of ought frame mortal mould
sith fairest flower fade quight
for see vain transitori
Ne held stedfast plight
but moment loos grace glori

and ye fond men fortun wheel ride
Or ought heaven repos assur
Be rich beauti honour pride
Be sure shall long endur
but ere ye awar flit away
for nought thonli usanc
Of small time none ascertain may

and ye true lover desastr chaunc
hath farr exil ladi grace
To mourn sorrow sad sufferauncc
when ye doe hear desert place
lament loud daphn elegi
help wail miser case
and life part vouchsaf close mine eye

and ye happi lover enioy
the presenc dearest love delight
when ye doe hear sorrowful annoy
yet pitti empassiond spright
and think mishap chaunst

for men state alik unstedfast

and ye ray fellow shepheard feed
your careless flock hil open plain
with better fortun succeed
rememb yet undeserv pain
and ye hear dead slain
lament lot tell fellowswain
that sad aleyon dyde life disdain

and ye fair damsel shepheard dear delight
that love rude heart possess
when hears shall happen sight
vouchsaf deck cyparess
and ever sprinckl brackish tear among
In piti undeserv d distress

and ye poor pilgrim restless toyl
weari selv wandr desart way
till come ye vow assoyle
when pass ye read woful lay
On grave written rue daphn wrong
and mourn languish day
ceas shepheard ceas end thi undersong

the heaviest plaint ever heard sound
hi cheek wext pale spright began faint
As again would fallen ground

but waie recomfort would
nor suffer solac approach nie
but cast sdeinful eie

As one dispos wilfulli die

tho pang somewhat overpast
and outragi passion nigh appeas

and dark night fast approch pleas
To turn asid unto cabinet

Of strong stownd sore beset

but mean could win thereto
Ne longer intreat staie
but without take leav foorth goe
with staggr pace dismal look dismay
As death face seen

Of mighti victor wide wound embrew

and ye fair nimph oftentim love

and ye fair blossom youth wanton breed

great god might reignest mynd
and bodi thi hest doest frame

that doest lion fell tiger tame
make cruell rage thi scornful game
and rore take great delight
who express glori thi might

Or aliv perfectli declar
the wondrou cradl thine infanci
when thi great mother venu first thee bare
begot plenti penuri
though elder thine nativiti
and yet chyld renew still thi year

for ere world still move mighti mass

In venu lap unarm nake
gan rear head clotho wake

and take wing heat
kindl first heaven lifegiv fyre
He gan move idl seat

and like fresh eagl made hardi flight
thro great wide wast yet want light

yet want light guid wandr way
hi fair mother creatur sake
did lend light own goodli ray
then world way gan take
the world till make
whose sundri part sever
the lyen confus ever

then gan raung huge array
and contrari forc conspyr

Or resembleth thimmortal flame
Of heavenli light beauti gloriou beam
what wonder rage extrem

At sight thereof much enravisht bee

which well perceiv imperi boy

which glanc thro eye with counten coy

Of careful wretch consum grief

thenceforth playn make full piteou mone
unto author baleful bane
the dai wast night griev grone
their live loath heaven light disdain
No light whose lamp doth yet remain

they deign see see still dye

the whylst thou tyrant love doest laugh scorn
At complaint make pain thi play
whylest lye languish like thral forlorn
the whyle thou doest triumph decay
and otherwhyl die delay
thou doest emmarbl proud hart
whose love life doe prefer

So hast thou often done ay
To thi vassal whose yet bleed hart
with thousand wound thou mangl hast sore
that whole remain scars littl part
yet augment anguish smart
thou hast enfrosen disdaineful brest
that one drop piti doth rest

whi honor unto thee

sith thou doest shew favour unto mee
Ne move ruth rebelli dame

somewhat slack rigour flame

To let live thu free dy

but thou indeed men thee call
the world great parent kind preserv
Of live wight soverain lord
how fall thi furiou fervour
thou doest afflict well notdeserv
As doeth thi love heast despiz
and thi subiect doth tyrann

yet herein eke thi glori seemeth
By hard handl best thee serv
that ere thou doest unto grace restor
thou mayest well trie ever swerv
and mayest make better deserv
and got may esteem
for thing hard gotten men dear deem

So hard heavenli beauti enfyr
As thing divin least passion doe impress
the stedfast mynd admyr
the stay stedfastness
but baseborn mind lamp regard less
which first blow take hasti fyre
such fanci feel love loos desyr

for love lord truth loialti

On golden plume purest skie
abov reach loathli sinful lust
whose base affect cowardli distrust
Of weak wing dare heaven fli
but like moldwarpe earth doth ly

To dirti dross higher dare aspyr
Ne feebl earthli eye endur
the flame light celestial fyre
which kindleth love gener desyr
and make mount nativ might
Of heavi earth heaven hight

In high thought would self excel
which behold still constant sight

whose imag print deepest wit
He thereon feed hungri fantasi

like tantal store doth sterv ly
So doth pine satieti
for nought may quench infinit desyr

In sight whereof bliss seem vain

love lift upon thi golden wing
from base world unto thi heaven hight
where may see admir thing
which thou workest thi soverain might
farr feebl reach earthli sight
that thereof heavenli hymn may sing
unto god love high heaven king

mani lewd lay ah woe
In prais mad fit fool call love
thheat youth made heretofor
that light wit loos affect move
but folli reprov
and turn tenor string
the heavenli prays true love sing

and ye wont greedi vain desir
To read fault wondr flame
To warm selv wide sparckl fire
sith heat quench quench blame
and ash shrowd die shame
for pass folli pursew
beginn own old fault renew

befor thi world great frame al thing
are containd found beingplac
ere flit time could wag eyas wing
about mighti bound doth embrac
the roll sphere part hour space

Of love dislik pride found
whom therefor equal honour crownd

with raignd time prescrib
In endless glori immortal might
togeth third deriv
most wise holi almighti spright
whose kingdom throne thought earthli wight
can comprehend much less trembl vers
with equal word hope rehers

yet O bless spirit pure lamp light
eternal spring grace wisedom trew
vouchsaf shed barren spright
some littl drop thi celestial dew
that may ryme sweet infuse embrew
and give word equal unto thought
To tell marveil thi merci wrought

yet pregnant still powreful grace
and full fruitful love love get

hi second brood though powr great

An infinit increas angel bright
all glistr gloriou maker light

To heaven illimit hight
not round heaven henc behold
adornd thousand lamp burn light
and ten thousand gemm shyne gold
He gave inherit hold
that might serv eternal bli
and partak ioy

there trinal triplic
about wait depend
either nimbl wing cut sky
when messag doth send
Or own dread presenc attend
where behold glori light
and carol hymn love day night
ver  trinal triplicities see faeri queen book
canto xii H

both day night unto one
for beam doth unto extend
that darkness appeareth never none
Ne hath day ne hath bliss end
but termeless time pleasur spend
Ne ever happiness decay
had dar d lord disobay

but pride impati long rest peac
did puff greedi bold ambit
that gan cast state increas
abov fortun first condit
and sit god seat without commiss
the brightest angel even child light
drew million god fight
ie lucif

thalmighti see bold assay
kindl flame consum yre
and one breath blew away
from heaven hight aspyr
To deepest hell lake damn fyre
where darkness dread horror dwell
hate happi light fell

So next offspr maker love
next himself gloriou degre
degendering hate fell
through pride pride love may ill agre
and sinn ensampl bee
how sinful flesh self assur
sith purest angel fell impur
degendering degener

but eternal fount love grace
still flow forth goodness unto
now see left wast empti place
In wyde pallac angel fall
cast suppli enstal
A new unknowen coloni therein
whose root earth base groundwork begin

therefor clay base vile nest nought
yet form d wondrou skill might
accord heavenli pattern wrought
which fashiond wise foresight
He man make breathd live spright
into face beautiful fayr
endewd wisedom rich heavenli rare

such made resembl might
himself mortal thing immortal could
him lord everi live wight
He made love own like mould
In might mighti self behould
for love doth love thing belov d see
that like self love shape may bee

but man forgetful maker grace
No less angel ensew
fell hope promist heavenli place
into mouth death sinner dew
and offspr thraldom threw
where ever bond remain
Of neverdead yet everdi pain

till great lord love first
made meer love like well
see lie like creatur long accurst
In deep horor despeyr hell
him wretch doole would let lenger dwell
but cast bondag redeem
and pay price debt extreem
doole pain
cast devis
all although

out bosom eternal bliss
In reign gloriou syre
He down descend like demisse
and abiect thrall flesh frail attyr
that might pay sinn deadli hyre
and restor unto happi state
In stood hapless fate
demisse humbl

In flesh first guilt commit
therefor flesh must satisfyd
nor spirit angel though man surpa
could make amend god man misguyd
but one man himself self slyde
So take flesh sacr virgin womb
for man dear sake man becom

and bless bodi born
without blemish reprochful blame
He freeli gave rent torn
Of cruell hand despightful shame
revyl vile becam
At length nayl gallowtre
and slew iust uniust decre

O huge unspeak impress
Of love deep wound pierst piteou hart
Of dear lord entyr affect
and sharpli launc everi inner part
dolour death soul dart
do die never deserv
To free foe heast swerv
heast command

what hart feel least touch sore launch
Or thought think depth dear wound
whose bleed sours stream yet never staunch
but stil flow freshli still redownd
To heal sore sinful soul unsound
and clens guilt infect cryme
which enroot fleshli slyme

O bless well love O flour grace
O gloriou morningstarr O lamp light
most live imag thi father face
etern king glori lord might
meek lamb god world behight
how thee requit good
Or prize thi preciou blood

yet nought thou askst lieu love
but love us guerdon thi pain
Ay us less behov

but life hath left unto us free

To feed hungri soul unto us lent

Of selfe mould self maker hand

Do kindl love high conceipt spright

Of fair form may lift hyer

To contempl thimmortal sky
Of soar faulcon learn flye

Of wyde univers therein reed

On everi side pyle flame brand

By view whereof plainli may appear

So likewis doe degre redound
and rise fair till last ariv

Of divin eternal maiesti

To impe wing thi high fli mynd

Or hard diamond doth pass

and great dragon strongli doth repress

from whenc proceed beam pure bright

which dart titan flame head
that beam enlumineth dark
and dampish air wherbi al thing red

Of mortal wit doth much amaz
the greatest wisards thereon gaze

but immortal light doth shine
Is mani thousand time bright clear

and even thought men plain appear
for theternal truth doth proceed
through heavenli vertu beam doe breed

with great glori wondrou light
hi throne encompass around
and hid own brightness sight
Of look thereon eye unsound
and underneath feet found

Ah gentl muse thou art weak faint

let angel goodli face behold

Of fair love mighti heaven king

but whoso may thrise happi man hold
Of earth god much doth grace
and let own belov behold

Ne ought earth want unto wight

and transport flesh spright

In see admir thing
As carri extasi
and hear heavenli note carol
Of god high prais fill brasen sky
and feel ioy pleasur inwardli
that maketh worldli care forget
and one think set

Ne thenceforth doth fleshli sens
Or idl thought earthli thing remain
but earst seemd sweet seem offenc
and pleas earst seem pain

and fair lamp useth enflam

thenceforth seem fowl full sinful blame
and pomp proud mind aspyr

Ah hungri soul long hast fed
On idl fanci thi foolish thought

which fled left thee nought
but late repent thi folli prief
Ah ceass gaze matter thi grief

and look last soverain light

Of vile world gayseem thing
with whose sweet pleasur possest
