the death OF agrican

boiardo

orlando ed agrican un altra fiata
ripreso insiem avean crudel battaglia
La piu terribil mai non fu mirata
larm lun laltro pezzo pezzo taglia
vede agrican sua gent sbarattata
Ne le puo dar aiuto che le vaglia
pero che orlando tanto stretto il tien
che star con seco front gli convien

nel suo segreto fe questo pensiero
trar fuor di schiera quel cont gagliardo
E poi che ucciso labbia su l sentiero
tornar la battaglia senza tardo
pero che lui par facil e leggiero
cacciar soletto quel popol codardo
che tutti insiem e l suo Re galafron
non li stimava quanto un vil botton

con tal proposto si pone fuggir
fort correndo sopra la pianura
Il cont nulla pensa quel fallir
anzi crede che l faccia per paura
senz altro dubbio se l pone seguir
E gia son giunti ad una selva scura
appunto mezzo quella selva piana
era un bel prato intorno una fontana

fermossi ivi agrican quella font
E smonto de larcion per riposar
Ma non si tols lelmo da la front
Ne piastra scudo si vols levar
E poco dimoro che giuns l cont
E come il vide la font aspettar
dissegli cavali tu sei fuggito
E si fort mostravi e tanto ardito

come tanta vergogna puoi soffrir
A dar le spall ad un sol cavaliero
fors credesti la mort fuggir
Or vedi che fallito hai il pensiero
chi morir puo onorato dee morir
che spess volt avvien e di leggiero
che per durar questa vita trista
mort e vergogna ad un tratto sacquista

agrican prima rimonto arcion
poi con voce soav rispondia
Tu sei per certo il piu franco baron
chio mai trovassi ne la vita mia
E pero del tuo scampo fia cagion
La tua prodezza e quella cortesia
che oggi si grand al campo usato mhai
quando soccorso mia gent donai

pero ti voglio la vita lasciar
Ma non tornasti piu per darmi inciampo
questo la fuga mi fe simular
Ne vebbi altro partito darti scampo
Se pur ti piac meco battagliar
morto ne rimarrai su questo campo
Ma siami testimonio il cielo e l sole
che darti mort mi dispiac e duol

Il cont gli rispos molto umano
perch avea preso gia di lui pietat
quanto sei diss piu franco e soprano
piu di te mi rincresc verit
che sarai morto e non sei cristiano
Ed anderai tra lanim dannat
Ma se vuoi il corpo e lanima salvar
piglia battesmo e lascierotti andar

diss agrican e riguardollo viso
Se tu sei cristiano orlando sei
chi mi facess Re del paradiso
con tal ventura non la cangierei
Ma sin ti ricordo e dotti avviso
che non mi parli de fatti de dei
perch potresti predicar invano
difenda suo ciascun co l brando mano

Ne piu parol trass tranchera
E verso orlando con ardir saffronta
Or si comincia la battaglia fiera
con aspri colpi di taglio e di ponta
ciascun e di prodezza una lumiera
E sterno insiem comil libro conta
Da mezzo giorno insino nott scura
sempr piu franchi la battaglia dura

Ma poi che l sol avea passato il mont
E cominciossi far il ciel stellato
prima verso del Re parlava cont
che farem diss l giorno n e andato
diss agrican con parol pront
ambi ci poseremo questo prato
E domattina come il giorno appar
ritorneremo insiem battagliar

cosi daccordo il partito si prese
lega il destrier ciascun come gli piac
poi sopra lerba verd si distes
come foss tra loro antica pace
luno laltro vicino era e pales
orlando presso al font isteso giac
Ed agrican al bosco piu vicino
stassi colcato lombra dun gran pino

E ragionando insiem tutta via
Di cose degn e condecenti loro
guardava il cont il ciel poscia dicia
questo ora veggiamo e un bel lavoro
che fece la divina monarchia
La luna dargento e le stell doro
E la luce del giorno e l sol lucent
dio tutto ha fatto per lumana gent

diss agrican Io comprendo per certo
che vuoi de la fede ragionar
Io di nulla scienza son esperto
Ne mai sendo fanciul volsi imparar
E ruppi il capo al maestro mio per merto
poi non si pote un altro ritrovar
che mi mostrass libro ne scrittura
tanto ciascun avea di paura

E cosi spesi la mia fanciullezza
In cacci giochi darm e cavalcar
Ne mi par che convenga gentilezza
star tutto il giorno ne libri pensar
Ma la forza del corpo e la destrezza
conviensi al cavaliero esercitar
dottrina al prete ed al dottor sta bene
Io tanto saccio quanto mi convien

rispos orlando Io tiro teco un seguo
che larmi son deluomo il primo onor
Ma non gia che l saper faccia un men degno
anzi ladorna com un prato il fior
Ed e simil un bove un sasso un legno
che non pensa leterno creator
Ne ben si puo pensar senza dottrina
La somma maestad alta e divina

diss agrican egli e gran scortesia
A voler contrastar con avvantaggio
Io ho scoperto la natura mia
E conosco sei dotto e saggio
Se piu parlassi io non risponderia
piacendoti dormir dormiti ad aggio
E se meco parlar hai pur diletto
darm amor ragionar aspetto

ora ti prego che quel ch io domando
risponda il vero fe uomo pregiato
Se se verament quell orlando
che vien tanto nel mondo nominato
E perch qui sei giunto e come e quando
E se mai fosti ancora innamorato
perch ogni cavali ch e senza amor
Se vista e vivo vivo senza core

rispos il cont quell orlando sono
che uccis almont e l suo fratel troiano
amor ha posto tutto abbandono
E venir fammi questo luogo strano
E perch teco piu largo ragiono
voglio sappi che l mio cor e mano
De la figliuola del Re galafron
che ad albracca dimora nel giron

Tu fai co l padr guerra gran furor
per prender suo paes e sua castella
Ed io qua son condotto per amor
E per piacer quella damisella
molt fiat son stato per onor
E per la fede mia sopra la sella
Or sol per acquistar la bella dama
faccio battaglia e daltro non ho brama

quando agrican ha nel parlar accolto
che questo e orlando ed angelica amava
fuor di misura si turbo nel volto
Ma per la nott non lo dimostrava
piangeva sospirando come un stolto
lanima e l petto e l spirto gli avvampava
E tanto gelosia gli batt il core
che non e vivo e di doglia non

poi diss orlando Tu debbi pensar
che come il giorno sara dimostrato
debbiamo insiem la battaglia fare
E luno laltro rimarra su l prato
Or duna cosa ti voglio pregar
che prima che vegnamo e cotal piato
quella donzella che l tuo cor disia
Tu labbandoni e lascila per mia

Io non potria patir essendo vivo
che altri con meco amass il viso adorno
O luno laltro al tutto sara privo
del spirto e de la dama al novo giorno
altri mai non sapra che questo rivo
E questo bosco ch e quivi dintorno
che labbi rifiutata cotal loco
E cotal tempo che sara si poco

diceva orlando al Re Le mie promess
tutt ho servat quant mai ne fei
Ma se quel che mi chiedi io promettess
E sio il giurassi io non lattenderei
cosi poria spiccar mie membra istess
E levarmi di front gli occhi miei
E viver senza spirto e senza core
come lasciar angelica lamor

Il Re agrican che ardeva oltr misura
non puot tal risposta comportar
bench sia l mezzo de la nott scura
prese bajardo e su ebb montar
Ed orgoglioso con vista sicura
isgrida al cont ed ebbel sfidar
dicendo cavali la dama gaglia
lasciar convienti far meco battaglia

era gia il cont su l arcion salito
perch come si moss il Re possent
temendo dal pagan esser tradito
salto sopra l destrier subitament
ond rispos con animo ardito
lasciar colei non posso per nient
E sio potess ancora io non vorria
avertela convien per altra via

come mar la tempesta gran fortuna
cominciarno l assalto cavalieri
nel verd prato per la nott bruna
con sproni urtarno addosso buon destrieri
E si scorgeano al lume de la luna
dandosi colpi dispietati e fieri
Ch era ciascun difor fort ed ardito
Ma piu non dico il canto e qui finito

ariosto

seguon gli scotti ove la guida loro
per lalta selva alto disdegno mena
poi che lasciato ha luno e laltro moro
lun morto tutto e laltro vivo pena
giacqu gran pezzo il giovin medoro
spicciando il sangu da si larga vena
che di sua vita al fin saria venuto
Se non sopravenia chi gli die aiuto

gli sopravenn caso una donzella
avvolta pastoral et umil vest
Ma di real presenzia e viso bella
dalt manier e accortament onest
tanto e chio non ne dissi piu novella
Ch pena riconosc la dovrest
questa se non sapet angelica era
del gran can del catai la figlia altiera

poi che l suo annello angelica riebb
Di brunel lavea tenuta priva
In tanto fasto tanto orgoglio crebb
chesser parea di tutto l mondo schiva
Se ne va sola e non si degnerebb
compagno aver qual piu famoso viva
Si sdegna rimembrar gia suo amant
abbia orlando nomato sacripant

E sopra ognaltro error via piu pentita
era del ben che gia rinaldo vols
troppo parendol essersi avvilita
Ch riguardar si basso gli occhi vols
tantarroganzia avendo amor sentita
piu lungament comportar non vols
dove giacea medor si pose al varco
E laspetto posto lo strale allarco

quando angelica vide il giovinetto
languir ferito assai vicino mort
che del suo Re che giacea senza tetto
piu che del proprio mal si dolea fort
insolita pietad mezo al petto
Si senti entrar per disus port
che le fe il duro cor tenero e moll
E piu quando il suo caso egli narrol

E rivocando alla memoria lart
chin india imparo gia chirurgia
che par che questo studio quella part
nobil e degno e di gran laud sia
E senza molto rivoltar di cart
che l patr figli ereditario il dia
Si dispos operar con succo derb
Ch piu matura vita lo riserb

E ricordossi che passando avea
veduta unerba una piaggia amena
foss dittamo foss panacea
O non qual di tal effetto piena
che stagna il sangu e de la piaga rea
leva ogni spasmo e perigliosa pena
La trovo non lontana e quella colta
dove lasciato avea medor die volta

nel ritornar sincontra un pastor
Ch cavallo pel bosco ne veniva
cercando una iuvenca che gli fuor
duo di di mandra e senza guardia giva
seco lo trass ove perdea il vigor
medor col sangu che del petto usciva
E gia navea di tanto il terren tinto
chera omai presso rimaner estinto

del palafreno angelica giu scese
E scender il pastor seco fece anch
pesto con sassi lerba indi la press
E succo ne cavo fra le man bianch
Ne la piaga ninfus e ne distes
E pel petto e pel ventr e fin lanch
E fu di tal virtu questo liquor
che stagno il sangu e gli torno il vigor

E gli die forza che pote salir
sopra il cavallo l pastor conduss
non pero vols indi medor partir
prima chin terra il suo signor non foss
E cloridan col Re fe sepelir
E poi dove lei piacqu si riduss
Et ella per pieta ne lumil case
del cortes pastor seco rimas

Ne fin che nol tornass sanitad
volea partir cosi di lui fe stima
tanto se inteneri de la pietad
che nebb come terra il vide prima
poi viston costumi e la beltad
roder si senti il cor dascosa lima
roder si senti il core e poco poco
tutto infiammato damoroso fuoco

stava il pastor assai buona e bella
stanza nel bosco infra duo monti piatta
con la mogli e co figli et avea quella
tutta di nuovo e poco inanzi fatta
quivi medoro fu per la donzella
La piaga breve sanita ritratta
Ma minor tempo si senti maggior
piaga di questa aver ella nel core

assai piu larga piaga e piu profonda
nel cor senti da non veduto strale
che da begli occhi e da la testa bionda
Di medoro avvent larcier cha lale
arder si sent e sempr il fuoco abonda
E piu cura laltrui che l proprio male
Di se non cura e non e ad altro intenta
Ch risanar chi lei fere e tormenta

La sua piaga piu sapr e piu incrudisc
quanto piu l altra si restring e salda
Il giovin si sana ella languisc
Di nuova febbr agghiacciata calda
Di giorno giorno lui belta fiorisc
La misera si strugg come falda
strugger di niev intempestiva suol
chin loco aprico abbia scoperta il sole

Se di disio non vuol morir bisogna
che senza indugio ella se stessa aiti
E ben le par che di quel ch essa agogna
non sia tempo aspettar ch altri la nviti
dunqu rotto ogni freno di vergogna
La lingua ebb non men che gli occhi arditi
E di quel colpo domando merced
che fors non sapendo esso le died

O cont orlando Re di circassia
vestra inclita virtu dite che giova
vostro alto onor dite che prezzo sia
O che merc vostro servir ritruova
mostratemi una sola cortesia
che mai costei vusass vecchia nuova
per ricompensa e guidardon e merto
Di quanto avet gia per lei sofferto

Oh se potessi ritornar mai vivo
quanto ti parria duro Re agrican
che gia mostro costei si averti schivo
con repuls crude et inuman
O ferrau mill altri chio non scrivo
chavet fatto mill pruov vane
per questa ingrata quanto aspro fora
S costu braccio voi la vedess ora

angelica medor la prima rosa
coglier lascio non ancor tocca inant
Ne persona fu mai si avventurosa
chin quel giardin potess por le piant
per adombrar per onestar la cosa
Si celebro con cerimoni sant
Il matrimonio chauspic ebb amor
E pronuba la mogli del pastor

fersi le nozz sotto allumil tetto
Le piu solenni che potean farsi
E piu dun mese poi stero diletto
duo tranquilli amanti ricrearsi
piu lung non vedea del giovinetto
La donna ne di lui potea saziarsi
Ne per mai sempr pendegli dal cello
Il suo disir sentia di lui satollo

Se stava allombra se del tetto usciva
avea di e nott il bel giovin lato
matino e sera questa quella riva
cercando andava qualch verd prato
nel mezo giorno un antro li copriva
fors non men di quel commodo e grato
chebber fuggendo lacqu enea e dido
De lor secreti testimonio fido

fra piacer tanti ovunqu un arbor dritto
vedess ombrar font rivo puro
vavea spillo coltel subito fitto
cosi se vera alcun sasso men duro
Et era fuori mill luoghi scritto
E cosi casa altri tanti il muro
angelica e medoro varii modi
legati insiem di diversi nodi

poi che le parv aver fatto soggiorno
quivi piu ch bastanza fe disegno
Di fare india del catai ritorno
E medor coronar del suo bel regno
portava al braccio un cerchio doro adorno
Di ricch gemm testimonio e segno
del ben che l cont orlando le volea
E portato gran tempo lavea

quel dono gia morgana ziliant
nel tempo nel lago ascoso il tenn
Et esso poi chal padr monodant
per opra e per virtu dorlando venn
Lo died orlando orlando chera amant
Di porsi al braccio cerchio dor sostenn
avendo disegnato di donarlo
alla regina sua di chio parlo

non per amor del paladino quanto
perchera ricco e dartificio egregio
caro avuto lavea la donna tanto
che piu non si puo aver cosa di pregio
Se lo serbo ne lisola del pianto
non gia dirvi con privilegio
La dove esposta al marin mostro nuda
Fu da la gent inospital e cruda

quivi non si trovando altra merced
chal buon pastor et alla mogli dessi
che serviti gli avea con si gran fede
dal di che nel suo albergo si fur messi
levo dal braccio il cerchio e gli lo died
E vols per suo amor che lo tenessi
indi saliron verso la montagna
che divid la francia da la spagna

dentro valenza dentro barcellona
per qualch giorno avean pensato porsi
fin che accadess alcuna nave buona
che per levant apparecchiass sciorsi
videro il mar scoprir sotto girona
Ne lo smontar giu de montani dorsi
E costeggiando man sinistra il lito
A barcellona andar pel camin trito

Ma non giunser prima chun uom pazzo
giacer trovaro su lestrem aren
che come porco di loto e di guazzo
tutto era brutto e volto e petto e schene
costui si scaglio lor come cagnazzo
Ch assalir foresti subito vien
E die noia e fu per far lor scorno

the jealousi OF orlando

the same

feron camin diverso cavallieri
Di qua zerbino e di la il cont orlando
prima che pigli il cont altri sentieri
allarbor tols e se ripos il brando
E dove meglio col pagan pensoss
Di potersi incontrar il destrier moss

Lo strano corso tenn il cavallo
del saracin pel bosco senza via
fece chorlando ando duo giorni fallo
Ne lo trovo ne pote avern spia
giuns ad un rivo che parea cristallo
Ne le cui spond un bel pratel fioria
Di nativo color vago e dipinto
E di molti e belli arbori distinto

Il merigg facea grato lorezo
Al duro armento et al pastor ignudo
Si che ne orlando sentia alcun ribrezo
che la corazza avea lelmo e lo scudo
quivi egli entro per riposarsi mezo
E vebb travaglioso albergo e crudo
E piu che dir si possa empio soggiorno
quellinfelic e sfortunato giorno

volgendosi ivi intorno vidi scritti
molti arbuscelli su lombrosa riva
tosto fermi vebb gli occhi e fitti
Fu certo esser di man de la sua diva
questo era un di quei lochi gia descritti
ove sovent con medor veniva
Da casa del pastor indi vicina
La bella donna del catai regina

angelica e medor con cento nodi
legati insiem e cento lochi vede
quant letter son tanti son chiodi
Co quali amor il cor gli pung e fied
Va col pensier cercando mill modi
non creder quel chal suo dispetto crede
chaltra angelica sia creder si sforza
chabbia scritto il suo nome quella scorza

poi dice conosco io pur quest note
Di tal io nhe tant e vedut e lett
finger questo medoro ella si puot
fors ch questo cognom mett
con tali opinion dal ver remot
usando fraud se medesmo stett
Ne la speranza il mal contento orlando
che si sepp se stesso ir procacciando

Ma sempr piu raccend e piu rinuova
quanto spenger piu cerca il rio sospetto
come lincauto augel che si ritrova
In ragna visco aver dato di petto
quanto piu batt lale e piu si prova
Di disbrigar piu si lega stretto
orlando vien ove sincurva il mont
A guisa darco su la chiara font

aveano su lentrata il luogo adorno
coi piedi storti eder e viti erranti
quivi soleano al piu cocent giorno
stare abbracciati duo felici amanti
vaveano nomi lor dentro e dintorno
piu che altro de luoghi circonstanti
scritti qual con carbon e qual con gesso
E qual con punt di coltelli impresso

Il mesto cont pie quivi disces
E vide su lentrata de la grotta
parol assai che di sua man distes
medoro avea che parean scritt allotta
del gran piacer che ne la grotta prese
questa sentenzia versi avea ridotta
che foss culta suo linguaggio io penso
Et era ne la nostra tale senso

liet piant verdi erb limpid acqu
spelunca opaca e di fredd ombr grata
dove la bella angelica che nacqu
Di galafron da molti vano amata
spesso ne le mie braccia nuda giacqu
De la commodita che qui e data
Io povero medor ricompensarvi
daltro non posso che dognior lodarvi

E di pregar ogni signor amant
E cavallieri e damigel e ognuna
persona paesana viandant
che qui sua volonta meni fortuna
challerb allombra allantro al rio all piant
dica benigno abbiat e sole e luna
E de le nimf il coro che provveggia
che non conduca voi pastor mai greggia

era scritta arabico che l cont
intendea cosi ben come latino
fra molt lingu e molt chavea pront
prontissima avea quella il paladino
E gli schivo piu volt e danni et ont
che si trovo tra il popul saracino
Ma non si vanti se gia nebb frutto
chun danno nha che puo scontargli il tutto

tre volt e quattro e sei less lo scritto
quello infelic e pur cercando vano
che non foss quel che vera scritto
E sempr lo vedea piu chiaro e piano
Et ogni volta mezo il petto afflitto
stringersi il cor sentia con fredda mano
rimas il fin con gli occhi e con la ment
fissi nel sasso al sasso indifferent

Fu allora per uscir del sentimento
Si tutto preda del dolor si lassa
credet chi nha fatto esperimento
che questo e l duol che tutti gli altri passa
caduto gli era sopra il petto il mento
La front priva di baldanza e bassa
Ne pote aver che l duol loccupo tanto
all querel voce umor al pianto

limpetuosa doglia entro rimas
che volea tutta uscir con troppa fretta
cosi veggian restar lacqua nel vase
che largo il ventr e la bocca abbia stretta
che nel voltar che si fa su la base
lumor che vorria uscir tanto saffretta
E ne langusta via tanto sintrica
Ch goccia goccia fuor esc fatica

poi ritorna se alquanto e pensa come
possa esser che non sia la cosa vera
che voglia alcun cosi infamar il nome
De la sua donna e crede e brama e spera
O gravar lui dinsopportabil
tanto di gelosia che se ne pera
Et abbia quel sia chi si voglia stato
molto la man di lei bene imitato

In cosi poca cosi debol speme
sveglia gli spirti e gli rifranca un poco
indi al suo brigliadoro il dosso preme
dando gia il sole alla sorella loco
non molto va che da le vie suprem
De tetti uscir vede il vapor del fuoco
sent cani abbaiar muggiar armento
vien alla villa e piglia alloggiamento

languido smonta e lascia brigliadoro
A un discreto garzon che nabbia cura
altri il disarma altri gli sproni doro
gli leva altri forbir va larmatura
era questa la casa ove medoro
giacqu ferito e vebb alta avventura
corcarsi orlando e non cenar domanda
Di dolor sazio e non daltra vivanda

quanto piu cerca ritrovar quiet
tanto ritrova piu travaglio e pene
che de lodiato scritto ogni paret
ogni uscio ogni finestra vede piena
chieder ne vuol poi tien le labra chete
che teme non si far troppo serena
troppo chiara la cosa che di nebbia
cerca offuscar perch men nuocer debbia

poco gli giova usar fraud se stesso
che senza domandarn e chi ne parla
Il pastor che lo vede cosi oppresso
Da sua tristrizia e che vorria levarla
listoria nota se dicea spesso
Di quei duo amanti chi volea ascoltarla
Ch molti dilettevol fu udir
glincomincio senza rispetto dire

come esso prieghi dangelica bella
portato avea medoro alla sua villa
chera ferito gravement e chella
curo la piaga e pochi di guarilla
Ma che nel cor duna maggior di quella
lei feri amor e di poca scintilla
lacces tanto e si cocent fuoco
che nardea tutta e non trovava loco

E sanza aver rispetto chella foss
figlia del maggior Re chabbia il levant
Da troppo amor constretta si conduss
A farsi mogli dun povero fant
allultimo listoria si riduss
che l pastor fe portar la gemma inant
challa sua dipartenza per merced
del buono albergo angelica gli died

questa conclus fu la secur
che l capo un colpo gli levo dal collo
poi che dinnumerabil battitur
Si vide il manigoldo amor satollo
celar si studia orlando il duolo e pure
quel gli fa forza e male ascond puollo
per lacrim e suspir da bocca e docchi
convien voglia non voglia al fin che scocchi

poi challagar il freno al dolor puot
che resta solo e senza altrui rispetto
giu da gli occhi rigando per le gote
sparg un fium di lacrim su l petto
sospira e geme e va con spess ruot
Di qua di la tutto cercando il letto
E piu duro chun sasso e piu pungent
che se foss durtica se lo sent

In tanto aspro travaglio gli soccorr
che nel medesmo letto che giaceva
lingrata donna venutasi porr
col suo drudo piu volt esser doveva
non altrimenti quella piuma abborr
Ne con minor prestezza se ne leva
che de lerba il villan che sera messo
per chiuder gli occhi e vegga il serp appresso

quel letto quella casa quel pastor
immantinent tantodio gli casca
che senza aspettar luna che lalbor
che va dinanzi al nuovo giorno nasca
piglia larm e il destriero et esc fuor
per mezo il bosco alla piu oscura frasca
E quando poi gli e avviso desser solo
con gridi et urli apr le port al duolo

Di pianger mai mai di gridar non resta
Ne la nott ne l di si da mai pace
fugg cittadi e borghi e alla foresta
Su l terren duro al discoperto giac
Di se si maraviglia chabbia testa
una fontana dacqua si vivac
E come sospirar possa mai tanto
E spesso dice se cosi nel pianto

quest non son piu lacrim che fuor
stillo da gli occhi con si larga vena
non suppliron le lacrim al dolor
finir ch mezo era il dolor pena
dal fuoco spinto ora il vital umor
fugg per quella via ch gli occhi mena
Et e quel che si versa e trarra insiem
E l dolor e la vita allor estrem

questi chindizio fan del mio tormento
sospir non sono ne sospir son tali
quelli han triegua talora io mai non sento
che l petto mio men la sua pena esali
amor che mard il cor fa questo vento
mentr dibatt intorno al fuoco lali
amor con che miracolo lo fai
che n fuoco il tenghi e nol consumi mai

non son non sono io quel che paio viso
quel chera orlando e morto et e sotterra
La sua donna ingratissima lha ucciso
Si mancando di fe gli ha fatto guerra
Io son lo spirito suo da lui diviso
chin questo inferno tormentandosi erra
accio con lombra sia che sola avanza
esempio chi amor pone speranza

pel bosco erro tutta la nott il cont
E allo spuntar della diurna fiamma
Lo torno il suo destin sopra la font
dove medoro insculs lepigramma
veder lingiuria sua scritta nel mont
lacces si chin lui non resto dramma
che non foss odio rabbia ira e furor
Ne piu indugio che trass il brando fuor

taglio lo scritto e l sasso e sin al cielo
A volo alzar fel minut schegg
infelic quellantro et ogni stelo
In cui medoro e angelica si legg
cosi restar quel di chombra ne gielo
A pastor mai non daran piu ne gregg
E quella font gia si chiara e pura
Da cotanta ira fu poco sicura

che rami e ceppi e tronchi e sassi e zoll
non cesso di gittar ne le bellond
fin che da sommo ad imo si turbol
che non furo mai piu chiar ne mond
E stanco al fin e al fin di sudor moll
poi che la lena vinta non rispond
allo sdegno al grave odio allardent ira
cade sul prato e verso il ciel sospira

afflitto e stanco al fin cade ne lerba
E ficca gli occhi al cielo e non fa motto
senza cibo e dormir cosi si serba
che l sole esc tre volt e torna sotto
Di crescer non cesso la pena acerba
che fuor del senno al fin lebb condotto
Il quarto di da gran furor commosso
E maglic e piastr si straccio di dosso

qui riman lelmo e la riman lo scudo
lontan gli arnesi e piu lontan lusbergo
larm sue tutt somma concludo
avean pel bosco different albergo
E poi si squarcio panni e mostro ignudo
lispido ventr e tutto l petto e l tergo
E comincio la gran follia si orrenda
che de la piu non sara mai chintenda

In tanta rabbia tanto furor venn
che rimas offuscato ogni senso
Di tor la spada man non gli sovvenn
che fatt avria mirabil cose penso
Ma ne quella ne scure ne bipenn
era bisogno al suo vigor immenso
quivi fe ben de le sue prove eccels
chun alto pine al primo crollo svels

E svels dopo il primo altri parecchi
come tosser finocchi ebuli aneti
E fe il simil di querc e dolmi vecchi
Di faggi e orni e illici abeti
quel chun uccel sapparecchi
Il campo mondo fa per por le reti
De giunchi e de le stoppi e de lurtich
facchi de cerri e altr piant antich

pastor che sentito hanno il fracasso
lasciando il gregg sparso alla foresta
chi di qua chi di la tutti gran passo
Vi vengono veder che cosa e questa

the death OF clorinda

tasso

Ma ecco omai lora fatal e giunta
che l viver di clorinda al suo fin deve
sping egli il ferro nel bel sen di punta
che simmerg e l sangu avido beve
E la vest che dor vago trapunta
Le mammel stringea tenera e leve
lempi dun caldo fium ella gia sent
morirsi e l pie le manea egro e languent

quel segu la vittoria e la trafitta
vergin minacciando incalza e preme
ella mentr cadea la voce afitta
movendo diss le parol estrem
parol ch lei novo spirto ditta
spirto di fe di carita di speme
virtu chor dio le infond e se rubella
In vita fu la vuol mort ancella

amico hai vinto io ti perdon perdona
Tu ancora al corpo che nulla pave
allalma si deh per lei prega e dona
battesmo chogni mia colp lave
In quest voci languid risuona
Un non che di flebil e soav
che al cor gli serp ed ogni sdegno ammorza
E gli occhi lagrimar gl invoglia e sforza

poco quindi lontan nel sen del mont
scaturia mormorando picciol rio
egli vaccors e lelmo empi nel font
E torno mesto al grand ufficio e pio
tremar senti la man mentr la front
non conosciuta ancor sciols e scoprio
La vide e la conobb e resto senza
E voce e moto ahi vista ahi cognoscenza

non mori gia che sue virtuti accols
tutt quel punto e guardia al cor le mise
E premendo il suo affanno dar si vols
vita collacqua chi col ferro uccis
mentr egli il suon de sacri detti sciols
colei di gioia trasmutossi e rise
E atto di morir lieto e vivac
dir parea sapr il cielo io vado pace

dun bel pallor ha il bianco volto asperso
come gigli sarian mist viol
E gli occhi al cielo affisa e lei converso
sembra per la pietat il cielo e l sole
E la man nuda e fredda alzando verso
Il cavaliero vece di parol
gli da pegno di pace In questa forma
passa la bella donna e par che dorma

come lalma gentil uscita ei vede
rallenta quel vigor chavea raccolto
E limperio di se libero cede
Al duol gia fatto impetuoso e stolto
Ch al cor si string e chiusa breve sede
La vita empi di mort sensi e l volto
gia simil estinto il vivo langu
Al color al silenzio agli atti al sangu

E ben la vita sua sdegnosa e schiva
spezzando sforza il suo ritegno frale
La bellanima sciolta alfin seguiva
che poco innanzi lei spiegava lale
Ma quivi stuol de franchi caso arriva
cui trae bisogno acqua daltro tale
E con la donna il cavali ne porta
In se mal vivo e morto lei ch e morta



No

tancr IN the enchant forest

the same

era prenc tancredi intanto sorto
A seppellir la sua diletta amica
E bench volto sia languido e smorto
E mal atto portar elmo e lorica
nulladimen poi che l bisogno ha scorto
Ei non ricusa il rischio la fatica
che l cor vivac il suo vigor trasfond
Al corpo si che par chesso nabbond

vassen il valoroso se ristretto
E tacito e guardingo al rischio ignoto
E sostien della selva il fero aspetto
E l gran romor del tuono e del tremoto
E nulla sbigottisc e sol nel petto
sent tosto il seda un picciol moto
trapassa ed ecco quel silvestr loco
sorg improvvisa la citta del foco

allor arretra e dubbio alquanto resta
fra se dicendo Or qui che vaglion larmi
nell fauci de mostri e n gola questa
divoratric fiamma andro gettarmi
non mai la vita ove cagion onesta
del comun pro la chieda altri risparmi
Ma ne prodigo sia anima grand
uom denso e tale e ben chi qui la spand

pur lost che dira sindarno io riedo
qual altra selva ha di troncar speranza
Ne intentato lasciar vorra goffredo
mai questo varco Or soltr alcun savanza
fors lincendio che qui sorto vedo
fia deffetto minor che sembianza
Ma seguan che puot E questo dire
dentro saltovvi oh memorando ardir

Ne sotto larm gia sentir gli parv
caldo fervor come di foco intenso
Ma pur se fosser vere fiamm larv
mal pote giudicar si tosto il senso
perch repent appena tocco sparv
quel simulacro e giuns un nuvol denso
che porto nott e verno e l verno ancora
E lombra dileguossi picciolora

stupido si intrepido riman
tancredi e poich vede il tutto cheto
mett securo il pie nell profan
sogli e spia della selva ogni secreto
Ne piu apparenz inusit e strane
Ne trova alcun per via scontro divieto
Se non quanto per se ritarda il bosco
La vista e passi inviluppato e fosco

alfin un largo spazio forma scorg
danfiteatro e non e pianta esso
salvo che nel suo mezzo altero sorg
quasi eccelsa piramid un cipresso
cola si drizza e nel mirar accorg
Ch era di varj segni il tronco impresso
simil quei che vece uso di scritto
lantico gia misterioso egitto

fra segni ignoti alcun note ha scort
del sermon di soria chei ben possied
O tu che dentro ai chiostri della mort
osasti por guerriero audac il pied
deh se non sei crudel quanto sei fort
deh non turbar questa secreta sede
perdona allalm omai di luce prive
non dee guerra co morti aver chi vive

cosi dicea quel motto egli era intento
dell brevi parol ai segni occulti
fremer intanto udia continuo il vento
tra le frondi del bosco e tra virgulti
E trarn un suon che flebil concento
par dumani sospiri e di singulti
E un non che confuso instilla al core
Di pieta di spavento e di dolor

pur tragg alfin la spada e con gran forza
percot lalta pianta Oh maraviglia
manda fuor sangu la recisa scorza
E fa la terra intorno se vermiglia
tutto si raccapriccia e pur rinforza
Il colpo e l fin vedern ei si consiglia
allor quasi di tomba uscir ne sent
Un indistinto gemito dolent

che poi distinto voci ahi troppo diss
M hai tu tancredi offesso tanto basti
Tu dal corpo che meco e per viss
felic albergo gia mi discacciasti
perch il misero tronco cui maffiss
Il mio duro destino ancor mi guasti
dopo la mort gli avversarj tuoi
crudel ne lor sepolcri offend vuoi

clorinda fui ne sol qui spirto umano
albergo questa pianta rozza e dura
Ma ciascun altro ancor franco pagano
che lassi membri pie dellalt mura
astretto e qui da novo incanto e strano
non io dica corpo sepoltura
son di sensi animati rami e tronchi
E micidi sei tu se legno tronchi

qual infermo talor chin sogno scorg
drago cinta di fiamm alta chimera
sebben sospetta part anco saccorg
che simulacro sia non forma vera
pur desia di fuggir tanto gli porg
spavento la sembianza orrida e fera
tale il timido amant appien non crede
Ai falsi inganni e pur ne teme e cede

E dentro il cor gli e modo tal conquiso
Da varj affetti che agghiaccia e trema
E nel moto potent ed improvviso
gli cade il ferro e l manco e lui la tema
Va fuor di se present aver gli e avviso
L offesa donna sua che plori e gema
Ne puo soffrir di rimirar quel sangu
Ne quei gemiti udir degro che langu

cosi quel contra mort audac core
nulla forma turbo alto spavento
Ma lui che solo e fievol amor
falsa imago delus e van lamento
Il suo caduto ferro instanto fuor
porto del bosco impetuoso vento
sicch vinto partissi e sulla strada
ritrovo poscia e ripiglio la spada

pur non torno ne ritentando ardio
spiar di novo le cagioni ascos
E poi che giunto al sommo duce unio
gli spirti alquanto e lanimo compos
incomincio signor nunzio son io
Di non credut e non credibil cose
cio che dicean dello spettacol fero
E del suon paventoso e tutto vero

maraviglioso foco indi mappars
senza materia un istant appreso
che sors e dilatando un muro fars
parv e armati mostri esser difeso
pur passai che ne lincendio ars
Ne dal ferro mi fu landar conteso
verno quel punto ed annotto fe il giorno
E la serenita poscia ritorno

Di piu diro chagli alberi da vita
spirito uman che sent e che ragiona
per prova sollo io nho la voce udita
che nel cor flebilment anco mi suona
stilla sangu de tronchi ogni ferita
quasi di moll carn abbian persona
No piu non potrei vinto mi chiamo
Ne corteccia scorzar ne sveller ramo
