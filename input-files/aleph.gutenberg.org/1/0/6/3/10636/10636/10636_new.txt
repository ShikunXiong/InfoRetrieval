Ed e da noi si strano
che quando ne ragiono
non trovo nessuno
che labbia navicato

Le parti del levant
La dove sono tant
gemm di gran valut
E di molta salut
E sono quello giro
balsamo e ambra e tiro
E lo pepe e lo legno
alo ch e si degno
E spigo e cardamomo
giengiovo e cennamomo
E altr molt spezi
ciascuna sua spezi
E miglior e piu fina
E sana medicina
appresso questo loco
mise assetto loco
Li tigri e li grifoni
leofanti e leoni
cammelli e dragomen
badalischi e gene
E panter e castoro
Le formich dell oro
E tanti altri animali
Ch io non ben dir quail
che son si divisati
E si dissomigliati
Di corpo e di fazion
Di si fera ragion
E di si strana taglia
chio non credo san faglia
Ch alcun uomo vivent
potess verament
per lingua per scrittur
recitar le figur
dell besti e gli uccelli

bien est voir que apr ce que messir marc pol avoit pri fame et
si estoit demour plusour an de sa vie venysse il avint que
mourut messir mafes qui oncl monseignour marc estoit et mourut
ausi se granz chien mastin quavoit amenei dou catai et qui
avoit non bayan pour lamour au bon chievetain bayan centiex
adonc navoit oncqu pui messir marc nullui for son esclav
pier le tartar avecqu lequel pouvoit penr soula sentretenir
de se voiag et de chose dou levant car la gent de venysse si
avoit de grant piesc moult anuy pri de lonc cont monseignour
marc et quand ledit messir marc issoit de luy sa meson ou sain
grisostom souloient li petit marmot es voi dariereli courir en
cryant messer marco milion cont nu un busion  que veult dire en
francoi messir marc de million dinou un de vo gro mensong
En oultr la dame donate fame anuyous estoit et de trop estroit
esprit et plainn de couvoitis ansi avint que messir marc
desiroit es voiag rantrer durement

Si se partist de venisse et chevaucha aux parti doccid Et
demoura mainz jour es contre de provence et de france et puy
fist passaig aux ysle de la tremontaingn et sen retourna par la
magne si comm vou orrez cyapr Et fistil escripr son voiag
atout le devis le contre me de la franc n parloit mie
grantment pour ce que maint genz la scevent apert Et pour ce en
lairon atant et commenceron dautr chose assavoir de bretaingn
LA grant

ci devys dou roiaum de bretaingn la grant

Et sachi que quand len se part de cales et len nage XX ou xxx
mill trop grant mesais si treuv len une grandism ysle qui
sapel bretaingn la grant ell est une grant royn et nen fait
treuag nulluy Et enseveliss lor mor et ont monnoy de chartr
et dor et dargent et ardent pierr noyr et vivent de marchandis
et dar et ont tout chose de vivr en grant habond mai non pa
bon marchi Et cest une ysle de trop grant richesc et li marini
de cell parti dient que cest li plu rich royaum qui soit ou
mond et quil li mieudr marini dou mond et li mieudr coursier
et li mieudr chevali ain ne chevauch mai lonc com francoi
ausi ontil trop bon home darm et vaillan durement bien que maint
n ait et le dame et damosel bonn et loiall et bell com
ly souef florant Et quoi vou en diroiej Il citez et chasteau
assez et tant de marcheanz et si rich qui font venir tant davoirde
poiz et de tout espec de marchandis quil nest hon qui la verit en
sceust dire font venir dynde et dautr parti coton grant
plant et font venir soy de manzi et de bangala et font venir
lain de ysle de la mer occean et de tout parti Et si labour
maintz bouqueran et touaill et autr drap de coton et de lain et
de soy encor sachi que ont vain dacier assez et si en
labour trop soubtiv de tou hernoi de chevali et de tout
chose besoign ost ce sont espe et glaiv et esperon et heaum
et hach et tout espec arteilleri et de couteleri et en font
grant gaaign et grant marchandis Et en font si grant habond que
tout li mond en puet avoir et bon marchi

encor cy devis dou dyt roiaum et de ce quen dist messir
marcs

Et sachi que tient icel royn la seigneuri de lynd majeure et
de mutfili et de bangala et dune moiti de mien Et moult est
saig et nobl dame et pourvean si que est ell ame de chascun Et
avoit jadi mari et depuy quil mourut bien xiv an avoit adonc la
royn sa fame lama tant que oncqu pui ne se voult marier nullui
pour lamour le princ son baron ancoi moult main quoy vie Et tient
son royaum ausi bien ou miex que oncqu le tindrent li roy si aioul
me ore en ce royaum li roy nont guier pooir ain la poissanc
commenc trespass la menu gent Et distrent aucun marini de
cele parti monseignour marc que huietl jour li royaum soit
auqu abastardi come je vou diroy car bien est voir que ciarrier
estoit ciz puepl de bretaingn la grant bonn et granz et loiall
gent qui servoit diex moult volonti selonc lor usaig et tuit li
labour quil labouroi et portoient vendr estoient honnest
labour et dou greigneur vaillanc et chose pardur et se
vendoient joust pri sanz barguigni En tant que se aucun labour
portoit lestanpil bretaingn la grant cestoit regardei com plege
de bonn estoff me orendroit li labour nest mie tousjourz si bon
et quand len achat pour un quintal pesant de toil de coton adonc
par trop souvent si treuv len de chascun C poi de coton bien xxx ou
XL poi de plastr de gif ou de blanc despaign ou de chose
semblabl Et se len achat de cammeloz ou de tireteinn ou dautr
dra de lain cist ne durent mie ain sont plain dempois ou de glu
et de balieur

Et bien quil est voir que chascun hon egal doit de son cor
servir son seigneur ou sa commun pour aler en ost en ten de
besoingn et bien que trestuit li autr royaum doccid tieingnent
ce pour orden ciz puepl de bretaingn la grant nen veult
nullement ain si dient veezla navon nou pa la manche pour
foss de nostr pourpri et pourquoy nou peneronsn pour nou fair
home darm en lessiant no gaaign et no soulaz cela lairon au
soudaier Or li preudhom entr eulx moult scevent bien com tiex
parol sont nyais me si ont paour de lour en dire la verit pour ce
que cuident desplair bourjoi et la menu gent

Or je vou di sanz faill que quand messir marc pols sceust ce
chose moult en ot piti de cestui puepl et il li vint remembr
ce que avenu estoit ou ten monseignour nicolas et monseignour
mafe lore quand alau frere charnel dou grant sire cublay ala
en ost seur baudas et print le calife et sa maistr cite atout son
vast tresor dor et dargent et lamer parol que dist ledit alau au
calif com l escript li maistr rusticien ou chief de cestui
livr

car sachi tout voirement que messir marc moult se deleitoit
fair appert combien sont pareil au font le condicion de divers
region dou mond et soloitil clorr son discour si disant en son
languag de veniss sto mondo xe fato tondo com uzoit dire me
oncl mafe

ore vou lairon conter de cest matier et retourneron parler de
la loy de genz de bretaingn la grant

ci devis de divers creanc de la gent bretaingn la grant et de
ce quen cuidoit messir marcs

Il est voir que li puepl est crestien me non pour le plu selonc
la foy de lapostoil rommain ain tiennent le en mautal assez
seulement il en aucun qui sont feoil du dit apostoil et encor
plu forment que li nostr prudhom de venisse car quand dit li
pape tell ou tell chose est noyr tout ladit gent si en jure
noyr est com poivr Et pui se dira li pape de la dite chose ell
est blanch si en jurera tout ladit gent il est voir quel est
blanch blanch est com noif Et dist messir marc pol nou
navon nullement tant de foy venyse ne li prudhom de florence
non plu com len puet savoir bien apert dou livr monseignour
dant aldiguiere que jay congneu padoe le meism que
messir thibault de cepoy venisse estoit me cest
joustement ce que jay veu autr foiz pre le grant bacsi qui est com
li pape de ydre

encor une autr manier de gent ce sont de celz qui sappel
filsouf et si il disent sil diex nen scavon nul me il
est voir quil est une certeinn couranc de chose laquex court
dever le bien Et fist messir marcs encor la creanc de
bacsi qui dysent que n ne diex eternel ne juge de home ain il
est une certeinn chose laquex sapel kerma

une autr foiz avint que disoit un de filsouf monseignour marc
diex nexist mie jeusquor aincoi il se fait desorendroit Et
fist encor messir marcs veezla une autr foiz la creanc de
ydre car dient que li seuz diex est icil hon qui par forc de se
vertuz et de son savoir tant pourchac que dhome il se face diex
present Et li tartar lappel borcan tiex diex sagamoni
borcan estoit dou quel parl li livr maistr rusticien

encor ont une autr manier de filsouf et dientil il nest mie
ne diex ne kerma ne couranc ver le bien ne provid ne creerr
ne sauvour ne saintet ne pechi ne conscienc de pechi ne proyer
ne respons proyer il nest null rien for que trop minim grain
ou paillett qui ont nom atosmes et de tiex grain devient chose
qui vive et chose qui vive devient une certeinn creatur qui demour
au rivaig de la mer et cest creatur devient poisson et poisson
devient lezar et lezar devient blayriau et blayriau devient
gatmaimon et gatmaimon devient hon sauvaig qui menju char
dhome et hon sauvaig devient hon crestien

Et dist messir marc encor une foiz biau sire li bacsi de
tebet et de kescemir et li prestr de seilan qui si dient que
larm vivant doie trespass par tou cez chang de vestemen si com
se treuv escript ou livr maistr rusticien que sagamoni borcan
mourut iiij vint et iiij foiz et tousjourz resuscita et chascun foiz
dune divers manier de best et la derrenier foyz mourut hon et
devint diex selonc ce quil dient Et fist encor messir marc
A moy pertil trop estrang chose se juesqu tout le creanc de
ydolastr deust decheoir cest grantz et saig nation ainsi peuent
jouer misir li filsouf atout lour propr pert me lore quand tiex
fantaisi se respanderont es joen bacheli et parmi la menu gent
celz averont pour tout loy manducemu et bibamu cra enim moriemur
et trop isnel len raccomencera la descent de leschiel et
dhome crestien deviendra hon sauvaig et dhome sauvaig gat
maimon et de gatmaimon blayriau Et fist encor messir marc
maint contre et provinc et ysle et citez je marc pol ay veue
et de maint genz de maint manier ay le condicionz congneu et
je croy bien que il est plu assez deden luniv que ce que li nostr
prestr n songent Et puet bien estr biau sire que li mond n
est cree tou poinz com nou creien ain dune sort encor plu
merveillous me cil namenuis nullement nostr pense de diex et de
sa majest ain la fait greingnour Et contre nay veue ou dame diex
ne manifest apert le granz euvr de sa toutpoissant saigess
gent nay congneu esquiex ne se fait sentir li fardel de pechi et la
besoingn de phisicien de maladi de larm tiex com est nostr
seignour ihesu crist beni soyt son non pensez doncqu cel qu
dit un de se apostr nolit ess prudent apud vosmet ipsos et
un autr quoniam multi pseudopropheta exierint et un autr
quod benient nobissimi diebu illusor  dicent ubi est
promissio  et encor au parol que dist li signour meism vide
ergo ne lumen quod te est tenebra sint

commant messir marc se partist de lysl de bretaingn et de la
proyer que fist

Et pourquoy vou en feroiej lonc cont Si print nef messir marcs
et se partist en nageant ver la terr ferm Or messir marc pol
moult ama cel roiaum de bretaingn la grant pour son viex renon et
sancienn franchis et pour sa saig et bonn royn que diex gart
et pour le mainz home de vaillanc et bon chaceour et le maint
bonn et honnest dame qui estoient Et sachi tout voirement que
en estant delez le bort la nef et en esgard au roch blanch que

ha sire diex ay merci de cestuy vieix et nobl royaum fayen
