well thought who would rather hear

than move stranger tongu

our social joy fame
life wither public look
whi mount pillori book
Or barter comfort name

who hous glass would dwell
with curiou eye everi pane
To ring
who want public crier bell

To see angel one way
who want play ass part
bear back wizard art
and servic speak bray

and manli lock would shave
and quench eye common sens
To share noisi recompens
that mock shorn blind slave

the heart need beyond head
and starv plenitud
Of strang gift crave common food
our human natur daili bread

We men god
To sit midheaven cold bleak
each separ pain peak
thincloak selfcomplac

better lot whose axe swung
In wartburg wood poor girl
who ilm spindl whirl
and sing song luther sung

than old cold vain
At weimar sat demigod
and bow jove imperi nod
hi votari

pli vaniti thi wing feet
ambit hew thi rocki stair
who envi feed air
the ici splendor seat

see alp cut
the dark cold sky dim lone
see ye sit stone stone
with human sens dull shut

could reach would
nor sit among cloudi shape
and spare fabl grape
and fox would could

keep lofti pedest
the safer plain choos
who never win rare lose
who never climb rare fall

let love eagl scream
divid home ice
for shall gentler note suffic

Oh yon pine crown steep

Oh yon fervid knoll might keep
while last world splendor

pale poplar wind lean
and sunset shiver
Oh golden stem might screen
for aye yon glassi river

that yon white bird homeward wing
softslid without motion
and blue air vanish
like snowflak lost ocean

beyond sight might never flee
yet onward still fli
and die day might
immort die

what wait earth deliver
Ah transfigur

she sing not mine holier shrine

the discover OF the north cape


A leaf from king alfr S orosiu


other old seacaptain
who dwelt helgoland
To alfr lover truth
brought snowwhit walrustooth
which held brown righthand

hi figur tall state
like boy eye appear
hi hair yellow hay
but thread silveri gray
gleam tawni beard

hearti hale other
hi cheek color oak
with kind laugh speech
like seatid beach
As unto king spoke

and alfr king saxon
had book upon knee
and wrote wondrou tale
Of first sail
into arctic sea

So far live northward
No man live north
To east wild mountainchain
and beyond mere plain
To westward sea

So far live northward
from harbor skeringeshal
If sail day
with fair wind way
more month would sail

six hundr reindeer
with sheep swine besid
tribut fin
whalebon reindeerskin
and rope walrushid

plough land hors
but heart ill eas
for old seafar men
came
with saga sea

Of iceland greenland
and stormi hebrid
and undiscov deep
could eat sleep
for think sea

To northward stretch desert
how far fain would know
So last salli forth
and three day sail due north
As far whaleship go

To west ocean
To right desol shore
but slacken sail
for walru whale
till three day

the day grew longer longer
till becam one
and southward haze
saw sullen blaze
Of red midnight sun

and upros
upon water edg
the huge haggard shape
Of unknown north cape
whose form like wedg

the sea rough stormi
the tempest howl wail
and seafog like ghost
haunt dreari coast
but onward still sail

four day steer eastward
four day without night
bound fieri ring
went great sun O king
with red lurid light

here alfr king saxon
ceas write
and rais eye book
with strang puzzl look
and incredul smile

but other old seacaptain
He neither paus stir
and king listen
onc took pen
and wrote everi word

and land said other
bent southward suddenli
and follow curv shore
and ever southward bore
into nameless sea

and hunt walru
the narwhal seal
Ha t nobl game
and like lightn flame
flew harpoon steel

there six us altogeth
norsemen helgoland
In two day
We kill threescor
and drag strand

here alfr truthtel
suddenli close book
and lift blue eye
with doubt strang surmis
depict look

and other old seacaptain
stare wild weird
then smile till shine teeth
gleam white underneath
hi tawni quiver beard

and king saxon
In wit truth
rais nobl head
He stretch brown hand said
behold walrustooth
