the miracl and other poem


the miracl

Up templ citi jew
the road ran straight white
To jericho citi palm
the citi delight

down still road far judean hill
the shepherd drove sheep
At silver dawn stir bird
when men asleep

full mani went weari way noon
Or rest tree
roman slave gentil beard priest
sinner pharise

but pink cloud drift far high
like rose leav blow past
when west one star bless sky
the gate day shut fast

all travel journey home moonlight
wash road fresh sweet
until seem gleam ivori path
wait royal feet



now noon life full tide
roll ever fro
A restless sea jerusalem
and whitewal jericho

blind bartimeu highway side
sat beg neath tree
and heard world go gentil jew
sinner pharise

blind bartimeu masklik face
and patient outstretch hand
He upon god set mark
No man might understand

blind bartimeu lone dark
who knew thing call fear
but dreamt dream heard littl sound
No man could hear

He heard beat bird soft wing
upris air
He heard camel footfal dust
and knew travel

He heard lizard move noon
On grey sunlit wall
He heard faroff templ bell time
He felt shadow fall

now golden hour stoop hear
A muffl sound low
the tramp myriad sandal feet
that came jericho

then road littl lad knew
ran past eager cri
Ho bartimeu give thine heart good cheer
for david son come

He come He come and sad one say
what He may thee
He make lame walk He heal sick
He make blind see

He make blind see Oh god host
beyond sky call blue
what messiah cometh hi
what word true

On swift way littl herald sped
like bird upon wing
and left lean brown beggar worldforgot
wait israel king

but dust came whirl feet
when mad throng drew near
blind bartimeu rose lip
A cri rang loud clear

the cri age soul
In sad captiv
the endless cri depth bitter woe
have merci upon

what though wild oncom multitud
jest bade ceas
what though scribe mighti pharise
told keep peac

what though heart grew faint strength
slip trembl limb
the one earth soul desir
stood still spoke

then silenc fell upheav throng
As seawav backward curl
left great path path shone
the light world

the light whose mysteri golden depth
the sun rose might
the light whose white hidden fire lit
the torch night

the light shine thing clay
giveth life will
the light unknown power blast
and bid life still

the light call ray light
A man undi soul
the light lift broken live earth
touch make whole

Up toward radianc bartimeu went
alon poor blind
feel way hapli led
To one fain would find

then spoke voic Oh mystic word
Of compel grace
the curtain rose darken sight
He saw king face

So strang beauti strang near
He worship eye
unheed last shone
the sunlit noonday sky

what though clamour crowd echo name
unto utmost rim
He saw christ light
He rose follow him



Oh bartimeu masklik face
and patient outstretch hand
wa god set thee mark
No man might understand




the crow

hail littl herald art thou return
from summer land wild windtorn day
hast brought word heart yearn
that spring way
hark now come clear insist call

from hill top crest untarnish snow
the trumpet note drift float fall
whene breez blow

winter spring come
the spring come back

tell prophet bird sombr feather
who taught thee mysteri spring
didst note pass mood wind weather
while fli north buoyant wing

Or didst thou rest upon bare brown branch
and hear sap go sing tree
didst watch keen farse downward glanc
the leav unlock cell fairi key

what though thi voic hath trace sweet
It thrill one
with promis joy complet
what time sky blue
when robin appletre fling
out air silver shower song
In lilac day children run asing
No singl thought shall thi memori wrong

winter spring come
sweet thi tide littl page black
winter spring come
the spring come back




when april come

when april come softli shine eye
and daffodil bound windblown hair
Oh coax cloud sky
and everi day bring sweet surpris
the swallow come swing air
when april come

when april come tender smile tear
dear dandelion gild common way
and break morn hear
the pipe robin crystal clear
while bobolink whistl day
when april come

when april come world wise old
will half forget worn grey
winter seem tale long told
it bitter wind frost cold
will bygon thing yesterday
when april come




kismet

love came unsought
love serv mani way
and patient love follow
throughout night day

love spent life
and hid tear sigh
He barter soul
with tender plead eye

her scarlet mouth smile
mock lightli woe
and would bid stay
she bid go

but hope within fail
until pled
and cold still turn face
away heart door



long day watch
for one never came
through sleepless night white lip bore
the burden name




A song OF summer day

As pearl slip silken string fall sea
these round summer day fall back etern

into deep whenc came mysteri
At set sun one slip back pearl sea

they sweet warm sweet love fain would hold fast
He weep finger tip slip away last




AT the play

just box high light fall
looketh carven face gild wall

van dyke beard broider ruff silent confess
that live love perchanc day good queen bess
lace fine linen sheer curl perfum hair
well becam gentlemen gay insouci air

see He gazeth evermor stage
noteth well player quickli come go
queen king maiden fair motley fool friar
lord ladi state dame mount knight squir

well knoweth grave gay
these dreamt far far away
saint sinner see come bygon year
and world still share laughter tear

still haunt greenwood love rosalind
still hear jester bell ajingl wind
still frenzi moor fear Ah even yet
breathless wait tomb capulet

though slow year pass away yet land sea
follow danish princ sad soliloquy
and fanci sometim round moon saileth high
yet venic meet jew goeth

just box high light fall
looketh carven face gild wall




christma

with littl children far near
god wot today ll sing song cheer
To rosi lip eye know guil
We one give back smile smile
and sake small gay
We children also today

holli ll hang mistleto
god wot today ll sing song love

for hath need
although dine silver delf
and pass nod christma day
may never meet life highway

but light lit day flown
god wot sit alon
who sit gaze ember glow
and watch strang thing flitter fro
the ghost dream face long unseen
shadow shadow thing




the heart courag

who hath heart courag
will fight right good cheer
for well may foe outfac
who own foe call fear

who hath heart courag
will fight knight old
for doth count
against world hold

who hath heart courag

against host invis
that hold soul bay

who hath heart courag

for time count foe

A song

love maketh summer time
T june love togeth
and littl care frost air
for heart make summer weather

love maketh winter time
and though hill blossom heather
If near t decemb dear
for heart make winter weather




the call

across dusti footworn street
unbless flower tree
faint faroff ever sound
the call sea

from quiet hill
where purpl shadow lie
the pine tree murmur come rest
and let world go

the west wind whisper night long
Oh journey forth afar
To green pleasant place
where littl river

and soft silken rustl
Of bend yellow wheat
say see harvest moon dim
the arclight street

though citi hold thee captiv
By trick wile lure
out yonder lie loveli
Of thing shall endur

the river road wide fair
the prairiepath free
and still old earth wait give
her strength joy thee




the knighterr

keen blood ran old mad desir
To right world wrong champion truth
deep eye shone heavenlit fire
and royal radiant daydream youth

graciou beggar stranger
and rose toss fair fingertip
He would ridden hardpress danger
the rose heart song lip

all king foe count foemen
hi say caus could lost
spirit like face enemi bowmen
On long vanish field count cost

wide outlook far vision
soulfret trifl sent wind
small grief gain cheer deris
god weather alway fair mind

but would comfort child cri
knightli deed distress
never beast roadsid lay die
He stoop gentl caress

and old sad broken

scatter tyrant set land free



In far time perchanc heart stronger
when faith men could face death alon
and would seem love last longer
such white soul would come

down citi peopl note
one silent thing went awri
toil dull task strang devot
To small deed kind other pass

down citi peopl note
one thought littl wealth way
one whose true word full often misquot
one laugh lightli blame prais

the fairi clock

silver clock O silver clock tell time day
Is yet littl hour left us work play

In dark perchanc weep left work undon

the slumber angel

when day end grey twilight fli
On silent wing across tire land
the slumber angel cometh sky
the slumber angel peac eye
and scarlet poppi hand

hi robe dappl like moonlit sea
hi hair wave silver float afar
He weareth lotusbloom sweet heartseas
with tassel rustl green fir tree
As dusk step star star

who giveth thing love best
beyond restless rock world




the lone road

We use fear lone road
that twist round hill
It dip riverway
and pass haunt mill
and crept reach
the churchyard green still

No piper ever took road
No gipsi brown gay
No shepherd gentl flock
No load scent hay
No marketwaggon jingl
On saturday

the dogwood flung wide star
In april silveri sweet
the squirrel cross path day
On tini fli feet
the wild brown rabbit knew turn
each shadowi safe retreat

and goldenbelt bee
sang sweet summer song
the cricket chirp moon
with steadi note strong
till cold silenc wrap round
when autumn night grew long

but oh brought lone dead
along quiet way
with strang process dark slow
On sunni day grey
We use watch wonderey
nor care play

and forgot merri jest
the bird bush tree
silenc song within throat
and us watch see
the soft slow pass sight
Of dark mysteri



We fear lone road
that wind around hill
far busi world highway
and god slowgrind mill
It seem peac path
pleasant green still




seaborn

In hive men make gold
He stood loom dawn dark
while pass year told

and knew summertim
By grey dust street
By linger hour daylight
and sultri noontid heat

Oh long captiv seabird
To leav cage free
for heart like shell kept sing
the old old song sea

and amid nois confus
Of wheel never still
He heard wind scent pine
On rough stormbeaten hill

while beyond maze paint thread
where tireless shuttl flew
In fanci saw sunlit wave
beckon blue




the angel

down white ward slow unswerv tread
He came ere break day
A cowl drawn downbent head
hi misti robe grey

and man even knew went
none saw heard pass
softli move cloud drift sky
Or shadow cross grass

close littl bed one lay low
At last took stand
and touch head toss restless woe
with gentl outstretch hand

when bitter said end
and joy grow far dim
angel lord doth send
To lead men him

past innumer star friend
past wind blow
We must travel journey end

nay known love far place
He said whenc came

but still cri moan tear
fear dark thee
there dark angel said fear
for go

there loneli nevermor
the shadowhaunt night
when pass beyond life swing door
the road said bright

then backward slip cowl head
downward robe grey
A radiant presenc lowli bed
greet break day



within long white ward one lay alon
none watch awhil
but pass said whisper tone
see lip smile




when christma come

for thee small one trinket new toy
the wine life keenest joy
when christma come
for broken playth past
that fold hand still hold fast
when christma come

for thee fair hope yet may
and tender dream sweetest mysteri
when christma come
for thee futur golden haze
for memori bygon day
when christma come

for thee thing lightli come go
for thee holli mistleto
when christma come

for frost snow mani year

but ah us mystic star
that leadeth back bethlehem afar
when christma come
for us child saw old
that evermor mother arm enfold
when christma come




the opal month

now cometh octob nutbrown maid
who robe crimson gold array

On world smile seem

Or memori may

opal agleam dusk hair
flash heart fire colour rare
As danc gaili

and tenderli hold breast
A belat butterfli

the cricket sing star

To entangl silken wing
but quail pipe low rust corn

and mist like incens curl feet

A song OF love

love reckon time may day delight

An empti nest would swing day night
It would weav strand close togeth
Or sing delight

methink twould wait littl eer pass
To meet old grey sea

If youth could understand tear sorrow
the sombr day age knowledg bring
It would eager morrow
Or spendthrift spring

If love learn soon life tread measur
how short swift hour told
each kiss tender word twould count treasur
As miser count gold

In cottag home saw candlelight

whose pensiv lip speak pray
doth sad novemb pass upon way

through forest aisl wind chanteth low
In god cathedr great tree grow
now day long paceth fro

when shadow gather nightmist rise
Up hill lift sombr eye
To last red rose sunset lie

A littl smile weareth wise cold
the smile one thing old
and life weari tale twice told

come see seem say joy fled

when grey eastern sky turn pink
through silver sedg pond low brink

Oh restless river restless sea
where great ship go dead men

you rest ladi girdl gold
and held hair

In god acr tender flower

and thi purpl censer ll set asw
To perfum twilight air

the harp world hung high
and shine string swallow fli

that day long come oer oer

and storm god roll

To song wild delight bitter dole

and quiet night faint far

they seem like soul long long lost
who breast oceanmain
vike whose vessel tempesttoss
voyag sail whatev cost
and never came home

Or stranger wilder fanci seem
As hear windtorn cri
No bird fli sun last gleam
but wraith hope ghost dream
that old seagod saw die

As jean de breboeuf told rosari
At sundown cell came call
clear bell rung ship sea
break beauti tranquil
down heart heaven seem fall

hail jean de breboeuf lift thee thi feet
not thi sin prayer shalt thou aton
thou wert made peac deepli sweet
thine midnight cold noonday heat
the journey wilder alon

too well thou lovest franc air
Is wine thi lip weed
are thine eye flower she fair
In mood thee even

that may follow thee place
and speak peopl thi name

the vineleaf shadow darken cell
and barefoot friar pass closeshut door
At vesper rang monasteri bell
yet still lay unheed fell
cross black outstretch upon floor



northward silenc night day
through unknown faith fail
into land beneath redman sway
the priest call jean de breboeuf took way
led polestar farblaz trail

He bore sacr wine cup bell
Of beaten bronz whose tongu warn bless
As done franc well
would ring marriag chime funer knell
for lone flock wilder

and like phantom ever side
point hour path scarc could see
By wood waterway went one still guid
who drift shade daylight die
into deep night mysteri

but reach place mani pine
god countri white man yet name
they beach birch cano neath swing vine
for indian read mani sign
lay wild land tribe huron claim

then like downdrop pearl round year
one one slip thread time
and jean de breboeuf labour oft fear
safehidden often still smile tear
among peopl northern clime

the forest children becom part
Of life alway spoke tongu
He dwelt within tent heart
He learn ancient woodcraft art
their race practis world young

He gave simpl truth faith
To men silenc subtl way
He share long hunger distress
when littl less

high vast cathedr tree
He hung bell bronz god name
He taught law love knee
In sundappl gloom midst bird bee
He lift cross word name

but evil day come the arrowhead

lest forest fire sweep midnight raid
make hunt ground common grave

It daybreak heard cri
the iroquoi the iroquoi they come

To linger villag die
steal river grass dumb

swiftli women children fled
but brave de breboeuf stay behind
Go cri chief good father dead
yet soft answer shook head
stay thee thi old blind

when red sun came creep sky
grey death reap harvest hate sown
the jesuit heard longer curs sigh
hi prayer said die
He face live iroquoi alon

they bound fast beneath forest green
and come shadowi edg night
nay ask horn owl hath seen
nor moon doth know white seren
the soul jean de breboeuf took flight




IN egypt

It angel azrael lord god sent
At midnight everi hous egypt long ago
long long ago


all day wife pharaoh pace palac hall
Or long white pillar court open sky
A passion wild restless ensnar thrall
while fought fear within thing would die

she sent away maiden weep vex ear
their pallid face fill impati piti scorn
but kept one timeworn woman long outgrown fear
the old brown nurs held son day born

the mighti god fail rivergod sun
and littl god brass stone stare made sign
So pled longer prayer said done
and neither bow head knelt shrine

her hair blown upon wind like wreath golden flame
and seablu eye cast blue shadow face
for egypt unto king came
A captiv yet princess northern seabound place

she watch fieri wheel roll behind level land
one small hand curl eye one heart
but rubi afterglow crept stain sand
she turn gaze toward goshen israel dwelt apart



nine plagu wast egypt tortur grim slow
the earth desol scar hail fire
still even yet lord refus let bondsmen go
To worship wilder god desir

the yellow nile turn blood watch eye
It brand memori haunt deathstrewn sight
the dust upon street rod made rise
In live move horror atom leprouswhit

the frog come thing bewitch armi without fear
they broken rush upward way take
and one follow steadili voic man could hear
while poison wind pestil came swiftli wake

then oh littl fli swarm earth air
and murrain camel cattl field
she pray king love hear peopl prayer
and send slave far hither love would yield

hi face like carven face upon basalt door
her beauti could charm voic lost power
So wrap veil entreat
but sat alon watch window tower

she saw hebrew leader uncov silveri hair
come priest daybreak outer palac gate
and rod woe wonder carri
yet pharaoh bid enter dare bid wait

but naught prevail sore diseas scourg low high
and hail god fallen crush grow grain
and fire hand kindl sear wrath swept
such fire none seen none would see

then came pirat locust seasong free bold
the spent broken peopl lack strength forc back
but watch take last green blade never would gold
and shut door foe turn meadow black

then pharaoh waver call hebrew hast
implor respit plead repent bitterli
for death everi side land wast
So western wind god blew locust sea

yet enough onc king deni given word
He dare wrath heaven made heart steel
then light god went man even stir
but stay companion fear dark could feel

So dread day gone slow depart night
and queen stood sunset alon grief shame
when one came run toward fail crimson light
A littl lad egypt eye hair like golden flame

thou long belov cri frown tenderli
inde seen thee sinc burn noon took wing
mother mine answer
these burden time egypt besid lord king

twill take countri mani day gain old time peac
but thou shalt suffer noth care thee
and see naught doth harm thee troubl ceas
these sad magic do man solv said

Ay that thou wilt said but tell doth fare king
doth relent Or face forbid dark cold
Or hath sent thee hither word bring
As leav council day grow old

He shook head came long see thee
and pharaoh read chart star time goe creep
Or sit weari silenc paceth fro
sinc banish magician fear save

put thi golden girdl mighti emerald clasp
and thi lotu broider robe braid thi hair cunningli
and wear wing headdress turquoi jewel asp
then come coax gloom thou canst said

wise counsellor smile nay wise thi short year
unto king great issu stake
thi time dare fail must go queenli without tear
Or humbl supplic one woe break

stay thou thi old nurs belov sitteth hall
and tell thee wondrou tale win thee smile
then take thi supper side deep night doth fall
Go tower whenc ll come littl

array love robe took state way
By courtier unattend palac vast still
her beauti thing hold bitter bay
To move heart men bend spirit

she pass beneath rose red light hung roof door
and unse god curl incens blue sweet
As one walk sleep cross cool mosaic floor
that echo music littl sandal feet

she reach council chamber enter silent
but though bow wise men reed wind could sway
would note littl she seem see
one face inscrut dark toward took way

the king sat still fate most high said come truth
Of new threat vengeanc there horror air
the ethiopian runner hath brought word sooth
blood sprinkl doorpost hebrew everywher

there rumour sayeth angel slay
the firstborn son egypt bondsmen depart
thi peopl weep anguish must hear thee say
the hebrew leader threaten danger heart

He heart inner heart straight strong
To meaneth egypt egypt meaneth son
So would take swiftli toward land belong
To return thee safeti troubl done

the street fill mourner everi day tear shed
the embalm grown weari work gold
and everywher eye doth see process dead
till seem mock phantom watch unmov cold

thou wilt let hebrew go read thine eye
there god egypt noth thi will
that set forc yet strength rise
but silenc thine answer bid thi voic still

then pharaoh lean toward beauti said
there man liveth dare say face
and truli one twere better dead
for dead men suffer nothing yet pray thee thi grace

have patienc hear T ethiop heard
they threaten firstborn tower brass stone
there son shall stay tonight guard well give thee word
where armi could enter one angel pass alon

thinkst thou one affright dark
A weakl play upon coward fool
nay defi israelit their weapon miss mark
they rous utmost anger taketh long cool

but thou said thou methink threaten thee
perchanc known qualiti fear
thou thing perfect loveli content mine eye
though land egypt blossom year

but thou art queen thou art free free go stay
would bind thee side one golden hair
leav thou land peril eer break day
Or give thi life dark life bear doth bear

then blanch face white lili gown
and low bow lili bow drift wind rain
My lord said except lay
At thi desir As done

thou art king son thine It mine say
that bear hence yet grope soul unto light
the quarrel twixt heaven thee alon stay
with love within tower throughout fate night

and angel cometh wall stone brass
and toucheth egypt son seal gentl breath
then know god god He hath right pass
our littl door He himself lord life death

O desert blossom like mystic silver rose
and moon shone palac deep guard gate
and softli touch lowli home fast bar foe
and lit face hewn stone seem watch wait

there came cri rend cri upon quiver air
the sudden wild lament nation pain
for firstborn son egypt young strong fair
had fallen dreamless sleep would wake

and within palac tower littl princ slept well
hi head upon mother heart knew alarm
for midnight hour sweet strang tell
she slept deepli child close fold arm

hard citi rode king unarm unhelmet
toward land loan bondsmen countri kept peac
He sway upon saddl look look dead
the peopl stare wonder though weep ceas

On ride goshen call aris aris
thou leader israelit t bid go
take thou peopl henc sun hath lit sky
get thee beyond border land death woe

across plain egypt shadow night
came sound armi move onward steadili
and leader read way star etern light
while legion follow journey sea

the moon shineth overhead saw mysteri
and world young hath mani year old
If egypt drank bitter cup even lee
who careth T ancient tale hath told


yet still hear footstep goeth fro
Of azrael angel lord god sent
To egypt long ago
