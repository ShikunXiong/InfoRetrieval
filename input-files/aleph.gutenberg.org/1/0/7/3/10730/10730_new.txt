for moon swept starless heaven
and latest line lower light
that linger stormi even
A dimseen line half cloud half wave
hath sunk welter grave
castleoban dark without within
and downward fear din
where ocean thunder shock
stun green foundat rock
through green abyss mock eye
oft hath eeri watchman sent
A shudder look shiver sigh
from edg howl battlement

therein lonesom room
undisturb old tomb
that built within forest glen
far feet live men
and shelter black pinetre
from sound river loch sea
fling back arch gateway tall
At time great funer
noiseless central cell
In bosom mountain
where fairi peopl dwell
By cold sunless fountain
breathless holi shrine
when voic psalm shed
and upon state bed
while raven lock reclin

motionless beneath head
and larg fair eyelid shine

By deep bliss disquiet
there sleep love beauti glow

Lo lamp wan fit light

To noth moulder one
age long ago

from pillow driven
By unseen demon hand
disturb repos heaven
hath fallen head the long black hair
from fillet silken band
In dishevel mass riven
Is stream downward floor
Is last convuls oer
and length gloriou tress
So laden soul distress
By fair hand morn light
abov eyelid open bright
Be braid nevermor
No ladi dead
though flung thu wildli oer bed
like wretch cors upon shore
that lie morn bring

Or hapli eye unknown
Is born away without groan
On chanc plank mid joy cri
Of bird pierc sunni sky
with seaward dash calm band
parad oer silveri sand
Or mid love flush shell
paus burnish crest wing
No fade footmark see tell
Of poor unrememb thing

O dread world dream
when world chao seem
Of thought fix
when heaven face ting blood
and friend cross oer solitud
now friend
Or dearer heart ever
keep stretch forth vain endeavour
their pale palsi hand
To clasp us phantom go
along void like drift snow
To faroff nameless land
yet know
nor dismal region lie
half hope curs deep
and wild sleep
and overpow scream
will break fetter dream
and let us back wake life
fill though care strife
sinc least wretch know
