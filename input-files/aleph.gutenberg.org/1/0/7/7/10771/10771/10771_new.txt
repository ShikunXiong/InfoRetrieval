and pass place must say tabi
If asuang come night
and throw big stone till die fright


now live santa cruz town
A littl girl known juanita calaon
she gentl sweet good could
and alway bow low balet tree


one day forest alon roam
To get good wood fire home
she gather twig found ground
and fast bundl bound


then happi free pack head
she follow road back town led
she sang walk happi
that ala bow balet tree


all heard terribl roar
and ticbalan fierc air seem soar
He seiz poor juanita quick could
He shut insid balet tree


two day pass girl fail come back
her parent went friend lack
To help search whole pueblo came
and loudli shout poor juanita name


At last thought search brought good
one man found juanita neat bundl wood
He call good news came see
loud knock heard balet tree


then mani frighten mani brave
and wonder mean girl could save
for knew must juanita knock
and insid balet tree lock


soon order candl music brought
and crucifix holi next sought
and readi close round tree
while pray true god set girl free


they light candl band play
and juanita mother afraid
advanc crucifix held hand
and tap cross evil tree grand


then roar shook forest chill heart
and aw balet split two part
then saw center big half fell
their darl juanita smile well


she ran tree fond mother dear
while band play everi one gave loud cheer
then back pueblo danc delight
and kept sing long night


still day lie balet tree
but peopl pass say tabi
and spirit molest man
for god power fierc ticbalan
