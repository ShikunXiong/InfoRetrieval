from women men brave old north
sad sight human eye
In fireless home neath wintri sky
where wrinkl gather childhood skin
and youth clemm d cheek pallid thin
where good honest uncloth unf
child mother father crave bread
but faint fear still trust
your voic heard claim
england england self true
and god peopl help

brother sister full well ye stood
while gripe gaunt famin curdl blood
No murmur threat lip place
though ye look hungerfiend face face
but haggard worn ye silent bear
drag deathchain patienc prayer
with heart loyal deed right
As plenti sleep blest day night
brother sister oh believ
It chariti gold alon ye receiv
Ah It sympathi feel hope
that pull lifeboat fling ye rope

fondli ve laud wealthwin hand
plant commerc fame throughout measureless land
and patriotlov patriotsong
To children labour ever belong
women men brave old soil

but glori see ye proudli mute
show soul like hero fang like brute
Oh keep courag within briton ye
HE driveth storm hath hi hand star

the smokeless chimney
BY A lancashir ladi   ejb

learn tale cheerless need

Ah perchanc landscap fairer

bring taint oer natur beauti

thoughtless fair one yon chimney
float golden breath life
stop current pleasur

Ah smokeless chimney
Is signal despair
they see hunger sick ruin
written pure bright air

mother mother see t truli
said last week mill would stop
mark yon chimney nought go
there smoke out oth top

father father reason
that chimney smokeless stand
Is true stranger
We must starv land

low upon chair mother
droop sigh tear eye
At hearthston lag father
muse oer day gone

day saw glad hearti
punctual work love
when week end brought plenti
and thank lord

when wage earn justli
gave cloth home food
when wife fond caress
bless heart kind good

neat clean sunday saw
In place prayer prais
littl dream morrow
piteou cri help would rais

week roll still yon chimney
give better time sign
men thousand cri labour
daili cri daili pine

now thing long dearli
prize pledg away
clock bibl marriagepres
both must go sad say

charley trot school longer
nelli grow pale day
nay babi shoe tini
must sold bread pay

they loath depend
now alm forc ask
hard millwork believ
beg bitterest task

soon come doom dread
with horror appal
Lo downcast face
grimli stare workhous wall

stranger sorrow touch
wide bid bounti flow
and assist poor endeavour
To reliev load woe

let smokeless chimney
draw one word prais
think oh think upon thousand
who moan day

rather pray peac soon bring
work plenti train
We may see smokeless chimney
blacken land

A sudden plung littl blow

O thoos wur laft beheend aw fear

god help the poor



BY samuel bamford

god help poor wintri morn
come forth alley dim court obscur
god help yon poor pale girl droop forlorn
and meekli afflict doth endur

god help outcast lamb trembl stand
all wan lip frozen red hand
her mourn eye modestli cast
her nightblack hair stream fit blast
her bosom pass fair half reveal d
and oh cold snow lie congeal d
her feet benumb d shoe rent worn
god help thee outcast lamb standst forlorn
god help poor

god help poor infant feebl wail
come yon narrow gateway behold
A femal crouch deathli pale
huddl child screen cold
her vestur scant bonnet crush d torn
A thin shawl doth babi dear enfold
and bide ruthless gale morn
which almost heart hath sent cold
and sudden dart raven look
As one new hot bread come past nook
and tempt load onward born
she weep god help thee hapless one forlorn
god help poor

god help poor behold yon famish d lad
No shoe hose wound feet protect
with limp gait look dreamysad
He wander onward stop inspect
each window store articl food
He yearn enjoy one cheer meal
Oh hungri palat viand rude
would yield zest famish d feel
He devour crust mouldi bread
with teeth hand preciou boon torn
unmind storm round head
impetu sweep god help thee child forlorn
god help poor
god help poor anoth found
A bow d vener man
hi slouch hat fade crape bound
hi coat gray threadbar see
the rude wind seem mock hoari hair
hi shirtless bosom blast bare
anon turn cast wist eye
and scant napkin wipe blind spray
and look fain would spi
friend hath feast better day
Ah dead long forborn
To know poor left forlorn
god help poor

god help poor lone valley dwell
Or far hill whin heather grow
their stori sad inde tell
yet littl care world seek know
the toil want poor weaver undergo
the irksom loom must morn
they work till wornout natur sleep
they tast fed cold snow drift deep
around fireless cot block door
the nightstorm howl dirg oer moss moor
and shall perish thu oppress d lorn
shall toil famin hopeless still born
No god yet aris help the poor



tickl time



BY edwin waugh

neaw time tickl wonder
one heart deawn shoon
but dang munnot knock
To th freawn misfortin soon
though robin look fear gloomi
An jami keep starin th greawnd
An thinkin oth tabl at empti
An th littl thing yammerin reawnd

Iv mon honest willin
An never stroke
An clemmin want ov shillin
It like make feel sad
It troubl heart keep seein
hi littl brid feedin oth air
An feel hard deein
An never mortal care

but life sich quar bit travel
A warlock wi sun wi shade
An bowster gravel
they lay n us bed wi spade
It use peawtin fratchin
As th whirligig twirlin areawn d
have keep scratehin
As lung yed upo greawnd

Iv one could feel ith insid nt
there troubl everi heart
An thoos n th biggest oth pride nt
oft leeten oth keenest oth smart
whatev may chanc come us
let patient hondl er share
for moni fine suit clooa
that cover murderin care

there danger everi station
ith palac weel ith cot
there hanker everi condit
An canker everi lot
there folk weari livin
that never feart hunger cowd
An moni miserli crayter

A mon troublesom schoo
that slave like hors livin
An fling away like foo
but pleasur sometim misfortin
An troubl sometim good thing
though liv n oth floor layrock
We n go like layrock sing
