To dishonour indulg heaven
If neighbour came free

from the campaign

behold aw march dread array

An anxiou horror bravest heart
yet beat breast demand strife
and thirst glori quell love life
No vulgar fear british mind control

though fen flood possess middl space
that unprovok would fear pass
nor fen flood stop britannia band
when proud foe rang border stand

but O muse number wilt thou find
To sing furiou troop battl join
methink hear drum tumultu sound
the victor shout die groan confound
the dread burst cannon rend sky
and thunder battl rise
T great malborough mighti soul prove
that shock charg host unmov
amidst confus horror despair
examin dread scene death survey
To faint squadron sent time aid
inspir repuls battalion engag
and taught doubt battl rage
So angel divin command
with rise tempest shake guilti land
such late oer pale britannia pass
calm seren drive furiou blast
and pleas th almighti order perform

with blue ether sky
and spangl heaven shine frame
their great origin proclaim
Th unweari sun day day
doe creator power display
and publish everi land

soon even shade prevail
the moon take wondrou tale
and nightli listen earth
repeat stori birth
whilst star round burn
and planet turn
confirm tide roll
and spread truth pole pole



what though solemn silenc
move round dark terrestri ball
what though real voic sound
amidst radiant orb found
In reason ear rejoic
and utter forth gloriou voic

who unequ war pursu
that triumph might

In disput whate said
My heart tongu beli
and look might read
how much argu side

you far danger fear

for seldom opinion err

whi fair one would reli
On reason forc beauti join

To keep beauteou foe view

but howe victori sure
contemn wreath long delay
and arm immedi power

So parthian turn steed
and hostil camp withdrew
with cruel skill backward reed
He sent fled slew

To take thi flight thou knowst whither

No matter beauti saw way

To folk bind prentic

Is god well bestow
the grumbl brute content

while everi one cri damn cheat

A glover sold lamb kid

At last anger swore d rid

and thu make fetter strong
To bind slavish soul

and set spirit free

the day OF judgment

when fierc northwind airi forc

the rape OF the lock

AN heroicom poem

canto

not glori th ether plain
the sun first rise oer purpl main
than issu forth rival beam
launch bosom silver thame
fair nymph welldress youth around shone
but everi eye fix alon
On white breast sparkl cross wore
which jew might kiss infidel ador
her live look sprightli mind disclos
quick eye unfix
favour none smile extend
oft reject never offend
bright sun eye gazer strike
and like sun shine alik
yet grace eas sweet void pride
might hide fault bell fault hide
If share femal error fall
look face ll forget em

thi nymph destruct mankind
nourish two lock grace hung behind
In equal curl well conspir deck
with shine ringlet smooth ivori neck
love labyrinth slave detain
and mighti heart held slender chain
with hairi spring bird betray
slight line hair surpris finni prey
fair tress man imperi race ensnar
and beauti draw us singl hair

Th adventur baron bright lock admir
He saw wish prize aspir
resolv win medit way
By forc ravish fraud betray
for success lover toil attend
few ask fraud forc attain end

for ere phoebu rose implor
propiti heaven everi power ador
but chiefli love love altar built
Of twelv vast french romanc neatli gilt
there lay three garter half pair glove
and trophi former love
with tender billetsdoux light pyre
and breath three amor sigh rais fire
then prostrat fall beg ardent eye
soon obtain long possess prize
the power gave ear grant half prayer
the rest wind dispers empti air

but secur paint vessel glide
the sunbeam trembl float tide
while melt music steal upon sky
and soften sound along water die
smooth flow wave zephyr gentli play
belinda smile world gay
all sylph care thought oppress
Th impend woe sat heavi breast
He summon straight denizen air
the lucid squadron around sail repair
soft oer shroud aerial whisper breath
that seem zephyr train beneath
some sun insect wing unfold
waft breez sink cloud gold
transpar form fine mortal sight
their fluid bodi half dissolv light
loos wind airi garment flew
thin glitter textur filmi dew
dip richest tinctur sky
where light disport evermingl dye
while everi beam new transient colour fling
colour chang whene wave wing
amid circl gild mast

hi purpl pinion open sun
He rais azur wand thu begun

ye sylph sylphid chief give ear
fay fairi genii elv demon hear
Ye know sphere variou task assign
By law etern th aerial kind
some field purest aether play
and bask whiten blaze day
some guid cours wander orb high
Or roll planet boundless sky
some less refin beneath moon pale light
pursu star shoot athwart night
Or suck mist grosser air
Or dip pinion paint bow
Or brew fierc tempest wintri main
Or oer glebe distil kindli rain
other earth oer human race presid
watch way action guid
Of chief care nation
and guard arm divin british throne

our humbler provinc tend fair
not less pleas though less gloriou care
To save powder rude gale
nor let th imprison essenc exhal
To draw fresh colour vernal flower
To steal rainbow ere drop shower
A brighter wash curl wave hair
assist blush inspir air
nay oft dream invent bestow
To chang flounc add furbelow

thi day black omen threat brightest fair
that eer deserv watch spirit care
some dire disast forc sleight
but fate wrap night
whether nymph shall break diana law
Or frail china jar receiv flaw
Or stain honour new brocad
forget prayer miss masquerad
Or lose heart necklac ball
Or whether heaven doom shock must fall
hast ye spirit charg repair
the flutter fan zephyretta care
the drop thee brillant consign
and momentilla let watch thine
Do thou crispissa tend favourit lock
ariel shall guard shock
To fifti chosen sylph special note
We trust th import charg petticoat

though stiff hoop arm rib whale

Be stop vial transfix pin
Or plung lake bitter wash lie
Or wedg whole age bodkin eye
gum pomatum shall flight restrain
while clog beat silken wing vain
Or alum styptic contract power

Or ixion fix wretch shall feel

In fume burn chocol shall glow

He spoke spirit sail descend

some thrid mazi ringlet hair
some hang upon pendant ear
with beat heart dire event wait

when numer waxlight bright order blaze

So long honour name prais shall live
what time would spare steel receiv date

steel could labour god destroy
and strike dust th imperi tower troy
steel could work mortal pride confound
and hew triumphal arch ground
what wonder fair nymph thi hair feel

from translat OF the iliad

the part OF hector and andromach

how would son troy arm renown
and troy proud dame whose garment sweep ground
attaint lustr former name
should hector base quit field fame
My earli youth bred martial pain
My soul impel th embattl plain
let foremost defend throne
and guard father glori
yet come day decre fate
how heart trembl tongu relat
the day thou imperi troy must bend
and see thi warrior fall thi glori end
and yet dire presag wound mind
My mother death ruin kind
not priam hoari hair defil d gore
not brother gasp shore
As thine andromach thi grief dread
see thee trembl weep captiv led
In argiv loom battl design
and woe larg part thine
To bear victor hard command bring
the weight water hyperia spring
there groan beneath load life
they cri behold mighti hector wife
some haughti greek live thi tear see
embitt thi woe name
the thought glori past present shame
A thousand grief shall waken name
may lie cold dread day
press load monument clay
thi hector wrap everlast sleep
shall neither hear thee sigh see thee weep

thu spoke th illustri chief troy
stretch fond arm clasp love boy
the babe clung cri nurs breast
scare dazzl helm nod crest
with secret pleasur fond parent smile
and hector hast reliev child
the glitter terror brow unbound
and place beam helmet ground
then kiss child lift high air
thu god prefer father prayer

O thou whose glori fill th ether throne
and ye deathless power protect son
grant like purchas renown
To guard trojan defend crown
against countri foe war wage
and rise hector futur age
So triumphant success toil
Of hero slain bear reek spoil
whole host may hail deserv acclaim
and say thi chief transcend father fame
while pleas amidst gener shout troy
hi mother consciou heart oerflow joy

He spoke fondli gaze charm
restor pleas burthen arm
soft fragrant breast babe laid
hush repos smile survey
the troubl pleasur soon chastis fear
she mingl smile tender tear
the soften chief kind compass view
and dri fall drop thu pursu

andromach soul far better part
whi untim sorrow heav thi heart
No hostil hand anted doom
till fate condemn silent tomb
fix term race earth
and hard condit birth
No forc resist flight save
all sink alik fear brave
No hasten thi task home
there guid spindl direct loom
Me glori summon martial scene
the field combat sphere men
where hero war foremost place claim
the first danger first fame


from AN essay ON man

OF the natur and state OF man with respect TO the univers

awak st john leav meaner thing
To low ambit pride king
let us sinc life littl suppli
than look us die
expati free oer scene man
A mighti maze without plan
A wild weed flower promiscu shoot
Or garden tempt forbidden fruit
togeth let us beat ampl field
tri open covert yield
the latent tract giddi height explor
Of blindli creep sightless soar
eye natur walk shoot folli fli
and catch manner live rise
laugh must candid
but vindic way god man



say first god man
what reason know
Of man see station
from reason refer
through world unnumb though god known
T trace
He vast immens pierc
see world world compos one univers
observ system system run
what planet circl sun
what vari peopl everi star
may tell heaven made us
but frame bear tie

Is great chain draw agre
and drawn support upheld god thee



presumptu man reason wouldst thou find
whi form weak littl blind
first thou canst harder reason guess
whi form weaker blinder less
ask thi mother earth oak made

Or ask yonder argent field
whi jove satellit less jove

Of system possibl t confess
that wisdom infinit must form best
where must full coher
and rise rise due degre
then scale reason life t plain
there must somewher rank man
and question wrangl eer long
Is god place wrong

respect man whatev wrong call

In human work though labour pain
A thousand movement scarc one purpos gain
In god one singl end produc
yet serv second use
So man seem princip alon
perhap act second sphere unknown
touch wheel verg goal

when proud steed shall know man restrain
hi fieri cours drive oer plain
when dull ox break clod
Is victim egypt god
then shall man pride dul comprehend
hi action passion use end
whi suffer check impel

then say man imperfect heaven fault

If perfect In certain sphere

heaven creatur hide book fate

Or could suffer

Oh blind futur kindli given

A hero perish sparrow fall

hope humbl trembl pinion soar

what futur bliss give thee know
but give hope thi bless
hope spring etern human breast

Lo poor indian whose untutor mind

To passion turn soon late

Or tree fame owl delight

when lubberkin town cattl drove
A maiden fine bedight hap love

and villag forsak plain
return lubberkin ditti hear

with sharp heel three time mark ground
and turn thrice around around around



last may day fair search find snail
that might secret lover name reveal
upon gooseberrybush snail found
for alway snail near sweetest fruit abound

In soft ash mark curiou L
Oh may wondrou omen lucki prove

To call truelov faithless town

thi mellow pippin pare around
My shepherd name shall flourish ground
fling th unbroken pare oer head
upon grass perfect L read

than pare mark upon green
with sharp heel three time mark ground
and turn thrice around around around

thi pippin shall anoth trial make
see core two kernel brown take
thi cheek lubberkin worn
and boobyclod side born
but boobyclod soon drop upon ground
A certain token love unsound
while lubberkin stick firmli last
Oh lip mine join fast
with sharp heel three time mark ground
and turn thrice around around around

As lubberkin slept beneath tree
twitch dangl garter knee
He wist hempen string drew
now mine quickli doff inkl blue
togeth fast tie garter twain
and knit knot repeat strain
three time truelov knot tie secur
firm knot firm may love endur
with sharp heel three time mark ground
and turn thrice around around around

As wont trudg last marketday
To town newlaid egg preserv hay

My purs grew heavi basket light

and lovepowd money spent
behap next sunday prayer
when alehous lubberkin repair
these golden fli mug ll throw
and soon swain fervent love shall glow
with sharp heel three time mark ground
and turn thrice around around around

but hold lightfoot bark cock ear
oer yonder stile see lubberkin appear
He come come hobnelia betray
nor shall crown willow die maid
He vow swear ll give green gown
Oh dear fall adown adown adown

and thrust muddi kennel side
He never turn dare oppos

samuel croxal


from the vision

pensiv beneath spread oak stood
that veil hollow channel flood
along whose shelv bank violet blue
and primros pale love mixtur grew
high overarch bloomi woodbin hung
the gaudi goldfinch mapl sung
the littl warbl minstrel shade
To gay morn due devot paid
next soft linnet echo thrush
with carol fill smell briarbush
while philomel attun artless throat
and hawthorn breath trill note

indulg natur smile everi part
and fill joy unknown ravish heart
attent listen feather throng
altern finish renew song

from ON the death OF mr addison

can forget dismal night gave
My soul best part forev grave
how silent old companion tread
By midnight lamp mansion dead
through breath statu unheed thing
through row warrior walk king
what awe slow solemn knell inspir
the peal organ paus choir
the duti lawnrob prelat paid
and last word dust dust convey
while speechless oer thi close grave bend
accept tear thou dear depart friend
Oh gone forev take long adieu
and sleep peac next thi love montagu

To strew fresh laurel let task mine
A frequent pilgrim thi sacr shrine
mine true sigh thi absenc bemoan
and grave faith epitaph thi stone
If eer thi love memori part
may shame afflict alien heart
Of thee forget form song
My lyre broken untun tongu
My grief doubl thi imag free
and mirth torment unchastis thee

oft let rang gloomi aisl alon
sad luxuri vulgar mind unknown
along wall speak marbl show
what worthi form hallow mould
proud name rein empir held
In arm triumph art excel

chief grace scar prodig blood
stern patriot sacr freedom stood
just men imparti law given
and saint taught led way heaven
neer chamber mighti rest
sinc foundat came nobler guest
nor eer bower bliss convey
A fairer spirit welcom shade



that aw form ye heaven decre
must still love still deplor
In nightli vision seldom fail rise
Or rous fanci meet wake eye
If busi call crowd court invit
Th unblemish statesman seem strike sight
If stage seek sooth care
meet soul breath cato
If pensiv rural shade rove
hi shape oertak lone grove
T good reason strong
clear great truth rais seriou song
there patient show us wise cours steer
A candid censor friend sever
there taught us live oh high
the price knowledg taught us die




thoma parnel


from A nightpiec ON death

By blue taper trembl light
No wast wake night
intent endless view pore
the schoolmen sage oer
their book wisdom wide stray
Or point best longest way
ll seek readier path go
where wisdom sure taught

how deep yon azur dye sky
where orb gold unnumb lie
while rank silver pride
the nether crescent seem glide
the slumber breez forget breath
the lake smooth clear beneath
where spangl show
descend meet eye
the ground right aspir
In dim view retir
the left present place grave
whose wall silent water lave
that steepl guid thi doubt sight
among livid gleam night
there pass melancholi state
By solemn heap fate
and think softlysad tread
abov vener dead
time like thee life possess
and time shall thou shalt rest

those grave bend osier bound
that nameless heav crumbl ground
quick glanc thought disclos
where toil poverti repos
the flat smooth stone bear name
the chisel slender help fame
which ere set friend decay
their frequent step may wear away
A middl race mortal
men half ambiti unknown
the marbl tomb rise high
whose dead vault arch lie
whose pillar swell sculptur stone
arm angel epitaph bone
these poor remain state
adorn rich prais great
who earth fame live
are senseless fame give

Ha gaze pale cynthia fade
the burst earth unveil shade
all slow wan wrap shroud
they rise visionari crowd
and sober accent cri
think mortal die

now yon black funer yew
that bath charnel hous dew
methink hear voic begin
Ye raven ceas croak din
Ye toll clock time resound
oer long lake midnight ground
It send peal hollow groan
thu speak among bone
when men scyth dart suppli
how great king fear
they view like last thing
they make dread sting
fool less provok fear
No spectreform appear
death path must trod
If man would ever pass god
A port calm state eas
from rough rage swell sea


A hymn OF content

love last peac mind
sweet delight humankind
heavenlyborn bred high
To crown favourit sky
with happi
than victor triumph know
whither O whither art thou fled
To lay thi meek content head
what happi region dost thou pleas
To make seat calm eas

ambit search sphere
Of pomp state meet thee
increas avaric would find
thi presenc gold enshrin

the bold adventur plough way
through rock amidst foam sea
To gain thi love perceiv
thou wert rock wave
the silent heart grief assail
tread soft lonesom oer vale
see daisi open river run
and seek vainli done
amus thought learn know
that solitud nurs woe
No real happi found
In trail purpl oer ground
Or soul exalt high
To rang circuit sky
convers star know
all natur form
the rest seek seek die
and doubt last knowledg rise

love last peac appear
thi world thou art
Is eden blest
and man contain breast

T thu shade stood
sung wish wood
and lost thought perceiv
the branch whisper wave
It seem quiet place
confess d presenc grace
when thu spoke go rule thi
bid thi wild passion still
know god bring thi heart know
the joy religion flow
then everi grace shall prove guest
and ll crown rest

Oh yonder mossi seat
In hour sweet retreat
might thu soul employ
with sens gratitud joy
rais ancient prophet
In heavenli vision prais prayer
pleas men hurt none
pleas bless god alon
then garden take sight
with colour delight
while silver water glide along
To pleas ear court song
ll lift voic tune string
and thee great sourc natur sing

the sun walk airi way
To light world give day
the moon shine borrow light
the star gild gloomi night
the sea roll unnumb wave
the wood spread shadi leav
the field whose ear conceal grain
the yellow treasur plain
all see
should sung sung
they speak maker
but want ask tongu man

Go search among idl dream
your busi vain extrem
and find life equal bliss
Or next begun

silent nymph curiou eye
who purpl even lie
On mountain lone van
beyond nois busi man
paint fair form thing
while yellow linnet sing
Or tune nightingal

come thi variou hue
come aid thi sister muse
now phoebu ride high
give lustr land sky
grongar hill invit song
draw landscap bright strong
grongar whose mossi cell
sweetli muse quiet dwell
grongar whose silent shade
for modest muse made
So oft even still
At fountain rill
sate upon floweri bed
with hand beneath head
while stray eye oer towi flood
over mead wood
from hous hous hill hill
till contempl fill
about chequer side wind
and leav brook mead behind
and grove grotto lay
and vista shoot beam day
wide wider spread vale
As circl smooth canal
the mountain round unhappi fate
sooner later height
withdraw summit sky
and lessen other rise
still prospect wider spread
add thousand wood mead
still widen widen still
and sink newlyrisen hill

now gain mountain brow
what landscap lie
No cloud vapour interven
but gay open scene
doe face natur shew
In hue heaven bow
and swell embrac light
spread around beneath sight

old castl cliff aris
proudli tower sky
rush wood spire
seem henc ascend fire
half beam apollo shed
On yellow mountainhead
gild fleec flock
and glitter broken rock

below tree unnumb rise
beauti variou dye
the gloomi pine poplar blue
the yellow beech sabl yew
the slender fir taper grow
the sturdi oak broadspread bough
and beyond purpl grove
haunt philli queen love
gaudi open dawn
lie long level lawn
On dark hill steep high
hold charm wander eye

deep feet towi flood
hi side cloth wave wood
and ancient tower crown brow
that cast aw look
whose rag wall ivi creep
and arm fall keep
So safeti wind
On mutual depend find

T raven bleak abod
T th apart toad
and fox secur feed
and poison adder breed
conceal ruin moss weed
while ever anon fall
huge heap hoari moulder wall
yet time seen lift low
and level lay lofti brow
ha seen broken pile complet
big vaniti state
but transient smile fate
A littl rule littl sway
A sunbeam winter day
Is proud mighti
between cradl grave

and see river run
through wood mead shade sun
sometim swift sometim slow
wave succeed wave go
A variou journey deep
like human life endless sleep
thu natur vestur wrought
To instruct wander thought
thu dress green gay
To dispers care away

ever charm ever new
when landscap tire view
the fountain fall river flow
the woodi valley warm low
the windi summit wild high
roughli rush sky
the pleasant seat ruin tower
the nake rock shadi bower

the town villag dome farm
each give doubl charm
As pearl upon aethiop arm

see mountain southern side
where prospect open wide
where even gild tide
how close small hedg lie
what streak meadow cross eye
A step methink may pass stream
So littl distant danger seem
So mistak futur face
eye hope delud glass
As yon summit soft fair
clad colour air
which journey near
barren brown rough appear
still tread coars way
the present still cloudi day

O may agre
and never covet see
content humbl shade
My passion tame wish laid
for wish wildli roll
We banish quiet soul
T thu busi beat air
and miser gather wealth care

now even joy run high
As mountainturf lie
while wanton zephyr sing
and vale perfum wing
while water murmur deep
while shepherd charm sheep
while bird unbound fli
and music fill sky
now even joy run high

Be full ye court great
search peac skill
open wide lofti door
seek marbl floor
In vain ye search
In vain ye search dome care

grass flower quiet tread
On mead mountainhead
along pleasur close alli
ever side
and often murmur rill
hear thrush still
within grove grongar hill

from winter

hardship and benevol

the keener tempest come fume dun
from livid east pierc north
thick cloud ascend whose capaci womb
A vapouri delug lie snow congeal
heavi roll fleeci world along
and sky sadden gather storm
through hush air whiten shower descend
At first thin waver till last flake
fall broad wide fast dim day
with continu flow the cherish field
put winter robe purest white
T bright save new snow melt

the winnow store claim littl boon
which provid assign one alon

In joyless field thorni thicket leav

hi shiver mate pay trust man
hi annual visit halfafraid first
against window beat brisk alight
On warm hearth hop oer floor
eye smile famili askanc
and peck start wonder
till familiar grown tablecrumb
attract slender feet the foodless wild
pour forth brown inhabit the hare
though timor heart hard beset
By death variou form dark snare dog
and unpiti men garden seek
urg fearless want the bleat kind
eye black heaven next glisten earth
with look dumb despair sad dispers

now shepherd helpless charg kind

and watch strict bellow east
In dire season oft whirlwind wing
sweep burthen whole wintri plain
At one wide waft oer hapless flock

As thu snow aris foul fierc
all winter drive along darken air
In looserevolv field swain

Of horrid prospect shag trackless plain
nor find river forest hid
beneath formless wild wander
from hill dale still astray

In mani vain attempt how sink soul
what black despair horror fill heart
when duski spot fanci feign

while round night resistless close fast
and everi tempest howl oer head
render savag wilder wild
then throng busi shape mind
Of cover pit unfathom deep
A dire descent beyond power frost
Of faithless bog precipic huge
smooth snow land unknown
what water still unfrozen spring
In loos marsh solitari lake
where fresh fountain bottom boil
these check fear step sink
beneath shelter shapeless drift

through wrung bosom die man
hi wife children friend unseen
In vain th offici wife prepar

In vain littl children peep

and oer inmost vital creep cold

Ah littl think gay licenti proud
whom pleasur power affluenc surround
they thoughtless hour giddi mirth
and wanton often cruel riot wast
Ah littl think danc along
how mani feel moment death
and sad varieti pain
how mani sink devour flood
Or devour flame mani bleed
By shame varianc betwixt man man
how mani pine want dungeon gloom

shut common air common use
Of limb mani drink cup
Of bale grief eat bitter bread
Of miseri sore pierc wintri wind
how mani shrink sordid hut
Of cheerless poverti mani shake
with fiercer tortur mind
unbound passion mad guilt remors
whenc tumbl headlong height life
they furnish matter tragic muse

with friendship peac contempl join
how mani rack honest passion droop
In deep retir distress mani stand

and point part anguish thought fond man
Of thousand nameless ill
that one incess struggl render life
one scene toil suffer fate

On natur write everi beam hi prais

while cloud cloud return solemn hymn

from the castl OF indol

O mortal man livest toil
Do complain thi hard estat
that like emmet thou must ever moil
Is sad sentenc ancient date
and cert reason great
for though sometim make thee weep wail
and curs thi star earli drudg late
withouten would come heavier bale
loos life unruli passion diseas pale

In lowli dale fast river side
with woodi hill oer hill encompass round
A enchant wizard abid
than fiend fell nowher found
It ween love spot ground
and season atween june may
half prankt spring summer half imbrown
A listless climat made sooth say
No live wight could work ne care even play

wa naught around imag rest
sleepsooth grove quiet lawn
and floweri bed slumbrou influenc kest
from poppi breath bed pleasant green
where never yet creep creatur seen
meantim unnumb glitter streamlet play
and hurl everywher water sheen
that bicker sunni glade
though restless still lull murmur made

join prattl purl rill
were heard low herd along vale
and flock loudbleat distant hill
and vacant shepherd pipe dale
and sweet philomel would wail
Or stock dove plain amid forest deep
that drowsi rustl sigh gale
and still coil grasshopp keep
yet sound yblent inclin sleep

pull passag vale
A sabl silent solemn forest stood
where naught shadowi form seen move
As idless fanci dream mood
and hill either side wood
Of blacken pine aye wave fro
sent forth sleepi horror blood
and valley wind
the murmur main heard scarc heard flow

A pleas land drowsyh
Of dream wave halfshut eye
and gay castl cloud pass
forev flush round summer sky
there eke soft delight witchingli
instil wanton sweet breast
and calm pleasur alway hover nigh
but whate smack noyanc unrest
wa far far expel delici nest

the landskip inspir perfect eas
where indol wizard hight
closehid castl mid embow tree
that half shut beam phoebu bright
and made kind checker day night
meanwhil unceas massi gate
beneath spaciou palm wick wight
wa place lute cruel fate
and labour harsh complain lament man estat

thither continu pilgrim crowd still
from road earth pass
for chaunc breath neighbour hill
the fresh valley smote eye
and drew ever anon nigh
till cluster round th enchant fals hung
ymolten syren melodi
while oer th enfeebl lute hand flung
and trembl chord tempt vers sung

behold ye pilgrim earth behold
see man unearn pleasur gay
see bright robe butterfli unfold
broke wintri tomb prime may
what youth bride equal array
who easi pleasur vie
from mead mead gentl wing stray
from flower flower balmi gale fli
Is beneath radiant sky

behold merri minstrel morn
the swarm songster careless grove
ten thousand throat flower thorn
hymn good god carol sweet love
such grate kindli raptur emov
they neither plough sow ne fit flail
eer barn nod sheav drove
yet harvest danc gale
whatev crown hill smile along vale

outcast natur man wretch thrall
Of bitterdrop sweat sweltri pain
Of care eat away thi heart gall
and vice inhuman train
that proceed savag thirst gain
for hardheart interest first began
To poison earth astraea left plain
guil violenc murder seiz man
and soft milki stream blood river ran

He ceas but still trembl ear retain
the deep vibrat witch song
that kind magic power constrain
To enter pellmel listen throng
heap pour heap yet slip along
In silent eas beneath beam
Of summer moon distant wood among
Or flood silver gleam
the softembodi fay airi portal stream



Of gentl tenant place
there man special grave remark
A certain tender gloom oerspread face
pensiv sad thought involv dark
As soot man could sing morn lark
and teach noblest moral heart
but talent yburi stark
Of fine store noth would impart
which boon natur gave naturepaint art

To noontid shade incontin ran
where purl brook sleepinvit sound
Or dan sol slope wheel began
amid broom bask ground
where wild thyme camomil found
there would linger till latest ray
Of light sate trembl welkin bound
then homeward twilight shadow stray
saunter slow pass mani day

yet thoughtless slumber pass
for oft heavenli fire lay conceal
beneath sleep ember mount fast
and nativ light anew reveal
oft travers cerulean field
and mark cloud drove wind
ten thousand gloriou system would build
ten thousand great idea fill mind
but cloud fled left trace behind

soam jenyn


from AN essay ON virtu

were maxim fix god friend
virtu good happi end
how soon must reason oer world prevail
and error fraud superstit fail
none would hereaft groundless fear
describ th almighti cruel sever
predestin without pretenc
To heaven hell offenc
inflict endless pain transient crime
and favour sect nation men time

To pleas none would foolishli forbear
Or food rest itch shirt hair
Or deem merit believ teach
what reason contradict within reach
none would fierc zeal pieti mistak
Or malic whatev tenet sake
Or think salvat one sect confin
and heaven narrow contain mankind



No servil tenet would admitt find
destruct right humankind
Of power divin hereditari right
and nonresist tyrant might
for sure thu one curs
Is great natur edict revers
No moralist righteou excess
would show fair virtu black dress
that like boy feign sprite array
first spectr fli away
No preacher terribl delight
but choos win reason affright
not conjuror like fire brimston dwell
and draw move argument hell



No applaus would ambit wait
and lay wast world count great
but one goodnatur act prais gain
than armi overthrown thousand slain
No would brutal rage disturb peac
but envi hatr war discord ceas
our other good hour employ
and thing smile univers joy
virtu happi consort join
would regul bless human mind
and man maker first design

Ye golden lamp heaven farewel

In brighter flame array
My soul spring beyond thi sphere
No demand thine aid

Ye star shine dust
Of divin abod

where shall reign god

shall hi beam display
nor shall one moment dark mix
with unvari day

No drop pierc grief
shall swell mine eye
nor meridian sun declin

In full concert join now brave youth

from the beast confess

when beast could speak learn say
they still everi day
It seem religion
As much find men
It happen plagu broke
which therefor made devout
the king brute make plain
Of quadrup mean
By proclam gave command
that everi subject land
should priest confess sin
and thu piou wolf begin
good father must shame
that often blame
must confess friday last
wretch broke fast
but defi basest tongu
To prove neighbour wrong
Or ever went seek food
By rapin theft thirst blood

the ass approach next confess
that heart love jest
A wag need must
and could let dunc alon

sometim friend would spare
and might perhap sever
but yet worst could said
He wit born bred
and sin shame
natur alon must bear blame
one fault sorri fort
hi ear half foot short
which could standard bring
He d show face king
then voic none disput
that nightingal brute

the swine contrit heart allow
hi shape beauti made proud
In diet perhap nice
but gluttoni neer vice
In everi turn life content
and meekli took fortun sent
inquir parish round
A better neighbour neer found
hi vigil might displeas
T true hate sloth like peas

the mimic ape began chatter
how evil tongu life bespatt
much censur world complain
who said graviti feign

He found virtu sever

To fond femal kind

though neither foe friend allow us

He never squeez needi client
and make constant rule

He freeli gave poor advic
By lost may affirm
A hundr fee last easter term
while other learn robe

No pleader bar could match

He fail could flatter
He learn turn coat

hi crime quickli understood

He found minist resent

He pass hour among book

He might worldli wise

but own stubborn spirit
that made trust alon merit

from vers ON the death OF DR swift

vain human kind fantast race
thi variou folli trace
selflov ambit envi pride
their empir heart divid
give other rich power station
T usurp
titl aspir
yet sink seem higher
In pope read line
but sigh wish mine
when one couplet fix
more sens six
It give jealou fit cri
pox take wit
griev outdon gay
In humor bite way
arbuthnot friend
who dare ironi pretend
which born introduc
refin first show use
st john well pultney know
that reput prose
and till drove date
could maul minist state
If mortified pride
and made throw pen asid
If talent heaven bless em
have reason detest em



suppos dead suppos
A club assembl rose
where discours
grow subject chat

and toss name
with favour without
one quit indiffer caus
My charact imparti draw

the dean believ report
wa never illreceiv court
As work vers prose
judg
nor tell critic thought em
but know peopl bought em
As moral view design
To cure vice mankind
hi vein iron grave
expos fool lash knave
To steal hint never known
but writ

he never thought honour done
becaus duke proud
would rather slip asid choos
To talk wit dirti shoe
despis fool star garter
So often seen caress chartr
He never court men station
nor person held admir
Of man great afraid
becaus sought man aid
though trust long great affair
He gave haughti air
without regard privat end
spent credit friend
and chose wise good
No flatter alli blood
but succour virtu distress
and seldom fail good success
As number heart must
who unknown



perhap may allow dean
had much satir vein
and seem determin starv
becaus age could deserv

yet malic never aim
He lash vice spare name
No individu could resent
where thousand equal meant
hi satir point defect
but mortal may correct
for abhor senseless tribe
who call humour gibe
He spare hump crook nose
whose owner set beaux
true genuin dul move piti
unless offer witti
those ignor confess
He never offend jest
but laugh hear idiot quot
A vers horac learn rote

he knew hundr pleas stori
with turn whig tori
wa cheer die day
and friend would let way

he gave littl wealth
To build hous fool mad
and show one satir touch
No nation want much

from the grave

see yonder hallow fane piou work
Of name fame dubiou forgot
and buri midst wreck thing
there lie inter illustri dead
the wind hark howl methink
till never heard sound dreari
door creak window clap night foul bird
rook spire scream loud gloomi aisl
black plaster hung round shred scutcheon
and tatter coat arm send back sound
laden heavier air low vault
the mansion dead rous slumber
In grim array grisli spectr rise
grin horribl obstin sullen
pass repass hush foot night
again screechowl shriek ungraci sound
ll hear make one blood run chill



oft lone churchyard night ve seen
By glimps moonshin chequer tree
the schoolboy satchel hand
whistl aloud bear courag
and lightli trip oer long flat stone
with nettl skirt moss oergrown
that tell home phrase lie
sudden start hear think hear
the sound someth pur heel
full fast fli dare look behind
till breath overtak fellow
who gather round wonder tale
Of horrid apparit tall ghastli
that walk dead night take stand
oer newopen grave strang tell
evanish crow cock

the newmad widow ve sometim spi
sad sight slow move oer prostrat dead
listless crawl along dole black
whilst burst sorrow gush either eye
fast fall untast cheek
prone lowli grave dear man
she drop whilst busi meddl memori
In barbar success muster
the past endear softer hour
tenaci theme still still think
she see indulg fond thought
cling yet close senseless turf
nor heed passeng look way



when dread trumpet sound slumber dust
not unattent call shall wake
and everi joint possess proper place
with new eleg form unknown
To first state nor shall consciou soul
mistak partner amidst crowd
singl half arm
shall rush impati man
that new come home long absent
with hast run everi differ room
In pain see whole thrice happi meet
nor time death shall part ever
T night long moonless night
We make grave bed gone

thu shut even weari bird
leav wide air lone brake
cower doze till dawn day
then clap wellfledg wing bear away

Of shag rock hang tremend oer

how sleep brave sink rest
By countri wish blest
when spring dewi finger cold
return deck hallow mould
she shall dress sweeter sod
than fanci feet ever trod

By fairi hand knell rung
By form unseen dirg sung
there honour come pilgrim grey
To bless turf wrap clay
and freedom shall awhil repair
To dwell weep hermit


ode TO even

If aught oaten stop pastor song
may hope chast eve sooth thi modest ear
like thi solemn spring

O nymph reserv brighthair sun
sit yon western tent whose cloudi skirt
with brede ether wove
oerhang wavi bed

now air hush save weakey bat
with short shrill shriek flit leathern wing
Or beetl wind
hi small sullen horn

As oft rise midst twilight path
against pilgrim born heedless hum
now teach maid compos
To breath soften strain

whose number steal thi darken vale
may unseemli still suit
As muse slow hail
thi genial love return

for thi foldingstar aris show
hi pali circlet warn lamp
the fragrant hour elv
who slept flower day

and mani nymph wreath brow sedg
and shed freshen dew loveli still
the pensiv pleasur sweet
prepar thi shadowi car

then lead calm votaress sheeti lake
cheer lone heath timehallow pile
Or upland fallow grey
reflect last cool gleam

but chill bluster wind drive rain
forbid will feet mine hut
that mountain side
view wild swell flood

and hamlet brown dimdiscov spire
and hear simpl bell mark oer
thi dewi finger draw
the gradual duski veil

while spring shall pour shower oft wont
and bath thi breath tress meekest eve
while summer love sport
beneath thi linger light

while sallow autumn fill thi lap leav
Or winter yell troublou air
affright thi shrink train
and rude rend thi robe

So long surefound beneath sylvan shed
shall fanci friendship scienc roselip health
thi gentlest influenc
and hymn thi favourit name

In lightn own secret sting
In one rude clash struck lyre
and swept hurri hand string

with woeful measur wan despair

and bade love scene distanc hail

while strain ball sight seem burst head

Of differ theme veer song mix

fresh soil thou turnst whose everi vale
shall prompt poet song demand
To thee thi copiou subject neer shall fail
thou needst take pencil thi hand
and paint believ thi genial land



there must thou wake perforc thi doric quill
T fanci land thou settst thi feet
where still t said fairi peopl meet
beneath birken shade mead hill
there trim lass skim milki store
To swart tribe creami bowl allot
By night sip round cottag door
while airi minstrel warbl jocund note
there everi herd sad experi know
how wing fate elfshot arrow fli
when sick ewe summer food forego
Or stretch earth heartsmit heifer lie
such airi be awe th untutor swain
nor thou though learn d homeli thought neglect
let thi sweet muse rural faith sustain
these theme simpl sure effect
that add new conquest boundless reign
and fill doubl forc heartcommand strain



even yet preserv often mayst thou hear
where pole boreal mountain run
taught father listen son
strang lay whose power charm spenser ear
At everi paus thi mind possess
old runic bard shall seem rise around
with uncouth lyre manycolour vest
their mat hair bough fantast crown
whether thou bidst welltaught hind repeat
the choral dirg mourn chieftain brave
when everi shriek maid bosom beat
and strew choicest herb scent grave
Or whether sit shepherd shiel
thou hearst sound tale war alarm
when bugl call fire steel
the sturdi clan pour forth boni swarm
and hostil brother met prove arm



T thine sing frame hideou spell
In skye lone isl gift wizard seer
lodg wintri cave fate fell spear
Or depth uist dark forest dwell
how whose sight dreari dream engross
with vision oft astonish droop
when oer wateri strath quaggi moss
they see glide ghost unbodi troop
Or sport festiv green
their destin glanc fate youth descri
who perhap lusti vigour seen
and rosi health shall soon lament die
for viewless form air obey
their bid heed beck repair
they know spirit brew storm day
and heartless oft like moodi mad stare
To see phantom train secret work prepar



To monarch dear hundr mile astray
oft seen fate give fatal blow
the seer skye shriek blood flow
when headless charl warm scaffold lay
As borea threw young aurora forth
In first year first georg reign
and battl rage welkin north
they mourn air fell fell rebellion slain
and late joy preston fight
saw sad falkirk hope near crown
they rave divin second sight
pale red culloden hope drown
illustri william britain guardian name
one william save us tyrant stroke
He sceptr gain heroic fame
but thou gloriou slaveri chain hast broke
To reign privat man bow freedom yoke



these thoult sing well thi magic muse
can topmost heaven grandeur soar
Or stoop wail swain
Ah home swain homeward step neer lose
let dank will mislead heath
danc mirki night oer fen lake
He glow draw downward death
In bewitch low marshi willow brake
what though far dark dell espi
hi glimmer maze cheer th excurs sight
yet turn ye wander turn step asid
nor trust guidanc faithless light
for watch lurk mid th unrustl reed
At mirk hour wili monster lie
and listen oft hear pass steed
and frequent round roll sullen eye
If chanc savag wrath may weak wretch surpris



Ah luckless swain oer unblest inde
whom late bewild dank dark fen
far flock smoke hamlet
To sad spot hum sedgi weed
On enrag fiend angri mood
shall never look piti kind concern
but instant furiou rais whelm flood
oer drown bank forbid return
Or medit wish escap
To dim hill seem upris near
To faint eye grim grisli shape
In terror clad shall wild appear
meantim wateri surg shall round rise
pour sudden forth everi swell sourc
what remain tear hopeless sigh
hi fearshook limb lost youthli forc
and wave float pale breathless cors



for vain anxiou wife shall wait
Or wander forth meet way
for vain tofal day
hi babe shall linger th unclos gate
Ah neer shall return alon night
her travel limb broken slumber steep
with drop willow dress mourn sprite
shall visit sad perchanc silent sleep
then perhap moist wateri hand
shall fondli seem press shudder cheek
and blueswoln face stand
and shiver cold piteou accent speak
pursu dear wife thi daili toil pursu
At dawn dusk industri
nor eer one hapless thought renew
while lie welter ozier shore
drown kelpi wrath eer shall aid thee

ode ON A distant prospect OF eton colleg

Ye distant spire ye antiqu tower

where grate scienc still ador

and ye state brow
Of windsor height th expans
Of grove lawn mead survey
whose turf whose shade whose flower among
wander hoari thame along

Ah happi hill ah pleas shade

As wave fresh gladsom wing
My weari soul seem sooth
and redol joy youth
To breath second spring

with pliant arm thi glassi wave

while earnest busi bent

gainst graver hour bring constraint
To sweeten liberti

and unknown region dare descri
still run look behind
they hear voic everi wind
and snatch fear joy

gay hope fanci fed

the tear forgot soon shed

their buxom health rosi hue

and live cheer vigour born
the thoughtless day easi night
the spirit pure slumber light
that fli th approach morn

ala regardless doom

No sens ill come
nor care beyond today
yet see around em wait
the minist human fate
and black misfortun bale train
Ah shew ambush stand
To seiz prey murder band
Ah tell men

these shall furi passion tear

disdain anger pallid fear
and shame skulk behind
Or pine love shall wast youth
Or jealousi rankl tooth
that inli gnaw secret heart
and envi wan fade care
grimvisag comfortless despair
and sorrow pierc dart

ambit shall tempt rise
then whirl wretch high
To bitter scorn sacrific
and grin infami
the sting falsehood shall tri
and hard unkind alter eye
that mock tear forc flow
and keen remors blood defil
and moodi mad laugh wild
amid severest woe

Lo vale year beneath
A grisli troop seen
the pain famili death
more hideou queen
thi rack joint fire vein
that everi labour sinew strain
those deeper vital rage
Lo poverti fill band
that numb soul ici hand
and slowconsum age

To suffer men

written IN A countri churchyard

the curfew toll knell part day
the low herd wind slowli oer lea
the ploughman homeward plod weari way
and leav world dark

now fade glimmer landscap sight
and air solemn still hold
save beetl wheel drone flight
and drowsi tinkl lull distant fold

save yonder ivymantl tower
the mope owl moon complain
Of wander near secret bower
molest ancient solitari reign

beneath rug elm yewtre shade
where heav turf mani moulder heap
each narrow cell forev laid
the rude forefath hamlet sleep

the breezi call incensebreath morn
the swallow twitter strawbuilt shed
the cock shrill clarion echo horn
No shall rous lowli bed

for blaze hearth shall burn
Or busi housewif pli even care
No children run lisp sire return
Or climb knee envi kiss share

oft harvest sickl yield
their furrow oft stubborn glebe broke
how jocund drive team afield
how bow wood beneath sturdi stroke

let ambit mock use toil
their home joy destini obscur
nor grandeur hear disdain smile
the short simpl annal poor

the boast heraldri pomp power
and beauti wealth eer gave
await alik th inevit hour
the path glori lead grave

nor ye proud imput fault
If memori oer tomb trophi rais
where longdrawn aisl fret vault
the peal anthem swell note prais

can stori urn anim bust
back mansion call fleet breath
can honour voic provok silent dust
Or flatteri sooth dull cold ear death

perhap neglect spot laid
some heart pregnant celesti fire
hand rod empir might sway
Or wake ecstasi live lyre

but knowledg eye ampl page
rich spoil time neer unrol
chill penuri repress nobl rage
and froze genial current soul

full mani gem purest ray seren
the dark unfathom cave ocean bear
full mani flower born blush unseen
and wast sweet desert air

some villag hampden dauntless breast
the littl tyrant field withstood
some mute inglori milton may rest
some cromwel guiltless countri blood

Th applaus listen senat command
the threat pain ruin despis
To scatter plenti oer smile land
and read histori nation eye
their lot forbad circumscrib alon
their grow virtu crime confin
forbad wade slaughter throne
and shut gate merci mankind

the struggl pang consciou truth hide
To quench blush ingenu shame
Or heap shrine luxuri pride
with incens kindl muse flame

far mad crowd ignobl strife
their sober wish never learn stray
along cool sequest vale life
they kept noiseless tenor way

yet even bone insult protect
some frail memori still erect nigh
with uncouth rhyme shapeless sculptur deck
implor pass tribut sigh

their name year spelt th unlett muse
the place fame elegi suppli
and mani holi text around strew
that teach rustic moralist die

for dumb forget prey

left warm precinct cheer day
nor cast one long linger look behind

On fond breast part soul reli
some piou drop close eye requir
even tomb voic natur cri
even ash live wont fire

for thee mind th unhonour dead
dost line artless tale relat
If chanc lone contempl led
some kindr spirit shall inquir thi fate

hapli hoaryhead swain may say
oft seen peep dawn
brush hasti step dew away
To meet sun upon upland lawn

there foot yonder nod beech
that wreath old fantast root high
hi listless length noontid would stretch
and pore upon brook babbl

hard yon wood smile scorn
mutter wayward fanci would rove
now droop woefulwan like one forlorn
Or craze care cross hopeless love

one morn miss custom hill

with wondrou art built airi seat
In next orchard live friendli thrush
nor distant far woodlark soft retreat

here bless eas bless
with earli song wake neighbour grove
till time matur joy crown nest
with infant pledg faith love

what equal fond dealt th allot food
what joy like descri

but ah earthli happi last
how fairest purpos often fail
A truant schoolboy wanton could blast
their flatter hope leav wail

No gener precept ever touch heart
with concord fals hideou prosodi
He scrawl task blunder oer part

On mischief bent mark raven eye
where wrap callow songster lay
then rush rude seiz glitter prize
and bore impiou hand away

but stall describ number rude
the pang poor chrysomitri decre
when secret stand aghast view

O grief grief shriek voic cri

O youth fair season die
from love fals joy bitter sorrow free

who sail wondrou lake around

rush rave boister sweep
and foam rend fright deep
thi gentl geniu shrink away
from rude unequ fray
through thine nativ dale rise
tremend rock amid sky

till smoothest channel find
soften horror scene
and confus flow seren
horror like first alarm
but soon savag grandeur charm
and rais noblest thought mind
thu fall lodor reclin
the craggi cliff impend wood
whose shadow mix oer half flood
the gloomi cloud solemn sail
scarc lift languid gale

Or oer head appear

To start command

To britain sink vale
Lo imperi brow see
from foul usurp vapour free

and thenc My muse flight forbear

where health plenti cheer labour swain

while secret laughter titter round place

from the minstrel OR the progress
OF geniu

fret thyself thou glitter child pride
that poor villag inspir strain
with thee let pageantri power abid
the gentl muse haunt sylvan reign
where wild grove eve lone swain
enraptur roam gaze natur charm
they hate sensual scorn vain
the parasit influenc never warm
nor whose sordid soul love gold alarm

though richest hue peacock plume adorn
yet horror scream discord throat
rise son harmoni hail morn
while warbl lark russet pinion float
Or seek noon woodland scene remot
where grey linnet carol hill
O let neer artifici note
To pleas tyrant strain littl bill
but sing heaven inspir wander



and yet poor edwin vulgar boy
deep thought oft seem fix infant eye
dainti heed gaud toy
save one short pipe rudest minstrelsi
silent glad affection though shi
and look demur sad
and laugh aloud yet none knew
the neighbour stare sigh yet bless lad
some deem wondrou wise believ mad



In truth strang wayward wight
fond gentl dread scene
In dark storm found delight
nor less oceanwav seren
the southern sun diffus dazzl sheen
even sad vicissitud amus soul
and sigh would sometim interven
and cheek tear piti roll
A sigh tear sweet wish control



when longsound curfew afar
load loud lament lone gale
young edwin light even star
linger listen wander vale
there would dream grave cors pale
and ghost charneldungeon throng
and drag length clank chain wail
till silenc owl terrif song
Or blast shriek fit shudder isl along



Or set moon crimson dy
hung oer dark melancholi deep
To haunt stream remot man hie
where fay yore revel wont keep
and let fanci rove larg till sleep
A vision brought entranc sight
and first wildli murmur wind gan creep
shrill ring ear taper bright
with instantan gleam illum vault night



nor ancient dame foe mirth
her ballad jest riddl quaint devic
oft cheer shepherd round social hearth
whom leviti spleen could neer entic
To purchas chat laughter price
Of decenc nor let faith exceed

Ah court citi breed

where midst chang sceneri ever new

rock torrent gulf shape giant size
and glitter cliff cliff fieri rampart rise

the lone enthusiast oft would take way

Of widewelt wave In black array
when sulphur cloud roll th autumn day
even hasten haunt man

what time lightn fierc career began
and oer heaven rend arch rattl thunder ran

thoma day


from the desol OF america

see see swift burst shade
the cruel soldier reek blade
and bloodi cross britain wave
point deed death host slave
To unheard wretch tell pain
and everi human sorrow sue vain
their harden bosom never knew melt
each woe unpiti pang unfelt
see rush savag joy
unsheath sword impati destroy
fierc tiger burst wood
with famish jaw insati blood

yet yet moment fell steel restrain
must natur sacr tie plead vain
Ah kindr blood remain unspilt
and heaven allow aw paus guilt
suspend war recogn band
against whose live arm impiou hand
not boast gallia proud domain
nor scorch squadron iberian plain
unhappi men foreign war wage
In blood glut frantic rage
and follow oppress lead
At everi step friend brother bleed



devot realm avail thi claim
To milder virtu sublim flame
Or avail unhappi land trace
the gener labour thi patriot race
who urg fate fortitud guid
On wild surg desper fortun tri
undaunt everi toil danger bore
and fix standard savag shore
what time fled avert eye
the bane influenc nativ sky
where slowli rise duski air
the northern meteor shot lurid glare
In vain countri geniu sought move
with tender imag former love
sad rise view charm
and weep woo wellknown arm
the favour clime soft domest air
and wealth eas care
sinc hate tyrant met eye
and blast everi bless sky



and natur bound confin
He A spread dragon pinion wind
the geniu west behold near
and freedom trembl last barrier

In vain deem sequest seat
To fix refug wander feet
To mark one altar sacr fame
and save ruin human name



Lo britain bend servil yoke
her fire extinguish spirit broke
beneath pressur tyrant sway
herself spoiler prey
detest virtu boast
and envi everi right everi shore
At natur piti blind
wage abhor war humankind
and wheresoe ocean roll wave
provok enemi meet slave

but freeborn mind inspir nobl flame
attest origin scorn claim
beyond sweet pleasur rest
the joy captiv vulgar breast
beyond dearer tie kindr blood
Or brittl life transitori good
the sacr charg liberti prize
that last noblest present sky



yet graciou heaven though cloud may interven
and transitori horror shade scene
though instant virtu sink depress
while vice exult rear bloodi crest
thi sacr truth shall still inspir mind
To cast terror fate behind
thi power natur utmost hound pervad
beam void cheer destruct shade
can blast laurel victor head
and smooth good man agon bed
To song triumph chang captiv groan
and hurl power dark throne

A novel train brood old romanc

and still fantast vain trifl sing
Of mani soft inconsist thing
Of rake repent clog hymen chain
Of nymph reclin unpresum swain
Of captain colonel lord amor knight

Of ball rout midnight masquerad

from the villag

the villag life everi care reign
oer youth peasant declin swain
what labour yield labour past
age hour languor find last
what form real pictur poor
demand song muse give

fled time harmoni strain
the rustic poet prais nativ plain
No shepherd smooth altern vers
their countri beauti nymph rehears
yet still frame tender strain
still lay fond corydon complain
and shepherd boy amor pain reveal
the pain ala never feel

On mincio bank caesar bounteou reign
If tityru found golden age
must sleepi bard flatter dream prolong
mechan echo mantuan song
from truth natur shall wide stray
where virgil fanci lead way
ye thu muse sing happi swain
becaus muse never knew pain
they boast peasant pipe peasant
resign pipe plod behind plough
and amid rural tribe time
To number syllabl play rhyme
save honest duck son vers could share
the poet raptur peasant care
Or great labour field degrad
with new peril poorer trade

from chief caus idl prais spring
that theme easi forbear sing
for deep thought trifl subject ask
To sing shepherd easi task
the happi youth assum common strain
A nymph mistress swain
with sad scene cloud tune prayer
but look like paint fair

grant inde field flock charm
for graze farm
but amid pleas scene trace
the poor labori nativ place
and see midday sun fervid ray
On bare head dewi templ play
while feebler head fainter heart
deplor fortun yet sustain part
then shall dare real ill hide
In tinsel trap poetic pride

No cast fortun frown coast
which neither grove happi valley boast
where care muse relat
and shepherd dwell mate
By exampl taught paint cot
As truth paint bard
nor ye poor letter scorn complain
To smoothest song smooth vain
oercom labour bow time
feel barren flatteri rhyme
can poet sooth pine bread
By wind myrtl round ruin shed
can light tale weighti grief oerpow
Or glad airi mirth toilsom hour

Lo heath wither brake grown oer
lend light turf warm neighbour poor
from thenc length burn sand appear
where thin harvest wave wither ear
rank weed everi art care defi
reign oer land rob blight rye
there thistl stretch prickli arm afar
and rag infant threaten war
there poppi nod mock hope toil
there blue bugloss paint steril soil
hardi high slender sheaf
the slimi mallow wave silki leaf
oer young shoot charlock throw shade
and clasp tare cling round sickli blade
with mingl tint rocki coast abound
and sad splendour vainli shine around



here wander long amid frown field
sought simpl life natur yield
rapin wrong fear usurp place
and bold art surli savag race
who skill take finni tribe
the yearli dinner septenni bribe
wait shore wave run high
On toss vessel bend eager eye
which coast direct ventur way
their ocean miser prey

As neighbour beach yon swallow stand
and wait favour wind leav land
while still flight readi wing spread
So wait favour hour fled
fled shore guilt famin reign
and cri ah hapless still remain
who still remain hear ocean roar
whose greedi wave devour lessen shore

till fierc tide imperi sway
sweep low hut hold away
when sad tenant weep door door
and beg poor protect poor

but scene natur niggard hand
gave spare portion famish land
her fault mankind complain
Of fruitless toil labour spent vain
but yet scene fair view
where plenti smile ala smile
and tast yet behold store
are slave dig golden ore
the wealth around make doubli poor
Or deem ampli paid health
labour fair child languish wealth
Go see rise sun
through long cours daili toil run
see beneath dogstar rage heat
when knee trembl templ beat
behold lean scyth look oer
the labour past toil come explor
see altern sun shower engag
and hoard ach anguish age
through fen marshi moor step pursu
when warm pore imbib even dew
then labour may fatal
To thi slave thine excess thee

amid tribe oft manli pride

there may see youth slender frame

He strive join fellow field
till longcontend natur droop last
declin health reject poor repast
hi cheerless spous come danger see
and mutual murmur urg slow diseas

yet grant health t us tell
though head droop heart well
Or prais home healthi fare
plenteou plain happi peasant share

Oh trifl want feel
nor mock miseri stint meal
home wholesom plain plenteou
As prais would never deign touch

Ye gentl soul dream rural eas
whom smooth stream smoother sonnet pleas
Go peac cot prais share
Go look within ask peac
If peac droop weari sire
Or offspr round feebl fire
Or matron pale whose trembl hand
turn wretch hearth th expir brand

nor yet time obtain
life latest comfort due respect eas
for yonder see hoari swain whose age
can care except engag
who prop rude staff look see
the bare arm broken wither tree
On boy climb loftiest bough
then first joy sad emblem

He chief rustic trade
hi steadi hand straightest furrow made
full mani prize still proud
To find triumph youth allow
A transient pleasur sparkl eye
He hear smile think sigh
for journey grave pain
the rich disdain nay poor disdain
altern master slave command
urg weak effort feebl hand
and age attempt task vain
with ruthless taunt lazi poor complain

oft may see tend sheep
hi winter charg beneath hillock weep
oft hear murmur wind blow
oer white lock buri snow
when rous rage mutter morn
He mend broken hedg ici thorn

whi live desir
At life life long labour free
like leav spring young blown away
without sorrow slow decay
like wither leaf remain behind
nip frost shiver wind
there abid till younger bud come
As fellowswain gone
then rise gener thrust
It fall like unnot dust

these fruit field numer flock see
are other gain kill care
To children youth lord
cool look hasti word
want demand care
feel want succour other
A lone wretch man pain go
none need help none reliev woe
then let bone beneath turf laid
and men forget wretch would aid

thu groan old till diseas oppress
they tast final woe rest

their yon hous hold parish poor
whose wall mud scarc bear broken door
there putrid vapour flag play
and dull wheel hum dole day
there children dwell know parent care
parent know children love dwell
heartbroken matron joyless bed
forsaken wive mother never wed
deject widow unheed tear
and crippl age childhood fear
the lame blind far happiest
the mope idiot madman gay
here sick final doom receiv
here brought amid scene grief griev
where loud groan sad chamber flow
mix clamour crowd
here sorrow kindr sorrow scan
and cold chariti man man
whose law inde ruin age provid
and strong compuls pluck scrap pride
but still scrap bought mani sigh
and pride embitt ca nt deni

say ye oppress fantast woe
some jar nerv baffl repos
who press downi couch slave advanc
with timid eye read distant glanc
who sad prayer weari doctor teas
To name nameless evernew diseas
who mock patienc dire complaint endur
which real pain alon cure
how would ye bear real pain lie
despis neglect left alon die
how would ye bear draw latest breath
where wretch pave way death

such room one rude beam divid
and nake rafter form slope side
where vile band bind thatch seen
and lath mud lie
save one dull pane coars patch give way
To rude tempest yet exclud day
here mat flock dust oerspread
the droop wretch reclin languid head
for hand cordial cup appli
Or wipe tear stagnat eye
No friend soft discours pain beguil
Or promis hope till sick wear smile

but soon load hasti summon call
shake thin roof echo round wall
anon figur enter quaintli neat
all pride busi bustl conceit
with look unalt scene woe
with speed enter speak hast go
He bid gaze throng around fli
and carri fate physic eye
A potent quack long vers human ill
who first insult victim kill
whose murder hand drowsi bench protect
and whose tender merci neglect
paid parish attend
He wear contempt upon sapient sneer
In hast seek bed miseri lie
impati mark avert eye
and habitu queri hurri oer
without repli rush door
hi droop patient long inur pain
and long unheed know remonstr vain
He ceas feebl help crave
Of man silent sink grave

but ere death piou doubt aris
some simpl fear bold bad men despis
fain would ask parishpriest prove
hi titl certain joy
for send murmr nurs call
the holi stranger dismal wall
and doth piou man appear
He pass rich forti pound year
Ah shepherd differ stock
and far unlik feed littl flock
A jovial youth think sunday task
As much god man fairli ask
the rest give love labour light
To field morn feast night
none better skill noisi pack guid
To urg chase cheer chide
A sportsman keen shoot half day
and skill whist devot night play
then honour bloom around head
shall sit sadli sick man bed
To rais hope feel zeal
To combat fear een piou feel



and hark riot green begin
that sprang first yonder noisi inn
what time weekli pay vanish
and slow hostess score threaten wall
what time ask friendli feast close
A final cup make foe
when blow ensu break arm toil
and rustic battl end boobi broil

save yonder hall bend way
where grave justic end grievou fray
He recit keep poor awe
the law vast volum know law
To anger shame repair
the injur peasant delud fair
Lo throne silent nymph appear
frail shape modest tear
and stand abash consciou eye
some favourit femal judg glide
who view scorn glanc strumpet fate
and thank star made keeper great
near swain bear life
one certain evil doubt twixt war wife
but falter damsel take oath
consent wed secur

yet ask humbl crime relat
whi make poor guilti great
To show great mightier son pride
how near vice lowest alli
such natur passion
but disguis littl much
So shall man power pleasur see
In slave vile wretch
In luxuri lord servant find
hi low pleasur degener mind
and kindr vice trace
Of poor blind bewild er race
who short time vari fortun past
die equal dust last




john newton


A vision OF life IN death

In evil long took delight
unaw shame fear
till new object struck sight
and stop wild career
saw one hang tree
In agoni blood
who fix hi languid eye
As near hi cross stood

sure never till latest breath
can forget look
It seem charg hi death
though word spoke
My conscienc felt own guilt
and plung despair
saw sin hi blood spilt
and help nail him

ala know
but tear vain
where shall trembl soul hid
for lord slain
A second look He gave said
freeli forgiv
the blood thi ransom paid
die thou mayst live

thu hi death sin display
In blackest hue
such mysteri grace
It seal pardon
with pleas grief mourn joy
My spirit fill
that life destroy
yet live him kill

from tabl talk

the poet and religion

piti religion seldom found
A skil guid poetic ground
the flower would spring where deign stray
and everi muse attend way
virtu inde meet mani rhyme friend
and mani compliment polit pen
but unattir becom vest
religion weav half undress
stand desert shiver forlorn
A wintri figur like wither thorn

the shelv full theme sped
hackney worn last flimsi thread
satir long sinc done best curst
and loathsom ribaldri done worst
fanci sport power away
In tale trifl children play
and t sad complaint almost true
whate write bring forth noth new
twere new inde see bard fire
touch coal heaven assum lyre
and tell world still kindl sung
with mortal music tongu
that He die reign
inspir song name love


from convers

the dubiou and the posit

dubiou scrupul good man
ye may catch trip
He would peremptori tone
assert nose upon face
with hesit admir slow
He humbl hope presum may
hi evid call law
To swear enorm saw
for want promin relief
would hang honest man save thief
through constant dread give truth offenc
He tie hearer suspens
know know knew
what rememb seem forgot
hi sole opinion whatsoe befal
center last none
yet though teas baulk listen ear
He make one use point exceed clear
howe ingeni darl theme
A sceptic philosophi may seem
reduc practic belov rule
would prove consumm fool
useless alik brain speech
fate place truth reach
hi ambigu total sum
He might well blind deaf dumb

where men judgment creep feel way
the posit pronounc without dismay
their want light intellect suppli
By spark absurd strike pride
without mean know right wrong
they alway decis clear strong
where other toil philosoph forc
their nimbl nonsens take shorter cours
fling head convict lump
and gain remot conclus jump
their defect invis
seen anoth condemn
and though selfidol everi case
hate like brother face
the caus plain deni
the proud alway provok pride
few competit engend spite
and neither right

A momentari dream thou art

My mother learn thou wast dead

perhap thou gavst though unfelt kiss
perhap tear soul weep bliss
Ah matern smile answer ye
heard bell toll thi burial day
saw hears bore thee slow away
and turn nurseri window drew
A long long sigh wept last adieu
but It thou art gone

may meet thee peac shore
the part word shall pass lip
thi maiden griev concern
oft gave promis thi quick return
what ardent wish long believ
and disappoint still still deceiv
By expect everi day beguil
dupe tomorrow even child
thu mani sad tomorrow came went
till stock infant sorrow spent
learnt last submiss lot
but though less deplor thee neer forgot

where dwelt name heard
children thine trod nurseri floor
and garden robin day day
drew school along public way

In scarlet mantl warm velvetcap
T becom histori littl known
that call pastor hous
shortliv possess but record fair
that memori keep thi kind
still outliv mani storm effac
A thousand theme less deepli trace
thi nightli visit chamber made
that thou mightst know safe warmli laid
thi morn bounti ere left home
the biscuit confectionari plum

By thi hand till fresh shone glow
all endear still
thi constant flow love knew fall

that humour interpos often make
all still legibl memori page
and still latest age
add joy duti make glad pay
such honour thee number may
perhap frail memori sincer
not scorn heaven though littl notic

could time flight revers restor hour
when play thi vestur tissu flower
the violet pink jessamin
prick paper pin
and thou wast happier
wouldst softli speak stroke head smile
could pleasant day appear
might one wish bring would wish
would trust heart dear delight
seem desir perhap might
but call life
So littl love thou much
that ill requit thee constrain
thi unbound spirit bond

thou gallant bark albion coast
the storm weather ocean cross
shoot port wellhaven isl
where spice breath brighter season smile
there sit quiescent flood show
her beauteou form reflect clear
while air impregn incens play

So thou sail swift hast reach shore
where tempest never beat billow roar
and thi love consort danger tide
Of life long sinc anchor thi side

but scarc hope attain rest

sail rip seam open wide compass lost
and day day current thwart forc
set distant prosper cours
yet oh thought thou art safe
that thought joy arriv may
My boast deduc birth
from loin enthron ruler earth
but higher far proud pretens rise
the son parent pass sky

and farewel time unrevok run

By contempl help sought vain

To renew joy mine

and wing fanci still free
and view mimic show thee

the castaway

obscurest night involv sky
the atlant billow roar
when destin wretch
wash headlong board
Of friend hope bereft
hi float home forev left

nobrav chief could albion boast
than went
nor ever ship left albion coast
with warmer wish sent
He love vain
nor beheld

not long beneath whelm brine
expert swim lay
nor soon felt strength declin
Or courag die away
but wage death last strife
support despair life

He shout friend fail
To check vessel cours
but furiou blast prevail
that pitiless perforc
they left outcast mate behind
and scud still wind

some succour yet could afford
and storm allow
the cask coop float cord
delay bestow
but knew ship shore
whate gave visit

nor cruel seem could
their hast condemn
awar flight sea
alon could rescu
yet bitter felt still die
desert friend nigh

He long surviv live hour
In ocean selfupheld
and long unspent power
hi destini repel
and ever minut flew
entreat help cri adieu

At length transient respit past
hi comrad
had heard voic everi blast
could catch sound
for toil subdu drank
the stifl wave sank

No poet wept page
Of narr sincer
that tell name worth age
Is wet anson tear
and tear bard hero shed
alik immort dead

therefor purpos dream
descant fate
To give melancholi theme
A endur date
but miseri still delight trace
it semblanc anoth case

No voic divin storm allay
No light propiti shone
when snatch effectu aid
We perish alon
but beneath rougher sea
and whelm deeper gulf

On white cliff calm flood
uprear shadow head feet

how mani lone wander stood
and whilst lift murmur met ear
and oer distant billow still eve
sail slow thought heart must leav
tomorrow friend love dear
Of social scene wept part
Oh like knew fruitless
the thought would full fain past recal
soon would quell rise heart
and brave wild wind unhear tide

there two soul congeni tie unit
No hirel bonz chant mystic rite
free everi thought action unconfin
and light fetter rivet bind
there grove slope bank along
and flower shrub odor herb among
each shepherd clasp undisguis delight
hi yield fair one captain sight
each yield fair chanc fanci led
prefer new lover sylvan bed
learn henc nymph whose free aspir mind
europ cold law colder custom bind
O learn natur genial law decre

Of whist cribbag mark th amus game

els would gamest anxiou ardour cool
dull everi deal stagnant everi pool
yet must one man one unceas wife
play long rubber connubi life
ye human law law esteem divin
the gener passion straighten confin
and stream art constrain cours
pour fierc torrent augment forc
So passion narrow one channel small
unlik former flow
for love flap purpl wing
when uncontrol priestcraft king


from the new moral

antipatriot and sentiment

with unspar hand
Oh lash vile impostur land

first stern philanthropi dri
the orphan tear wipe widow eye
not saint chariti guid
Of british bounti pour annual tide
but french philanthropi whose boundless mind
glow gener love mankind
philanthropi beneath whose bane sway
each patriot passion sink die away
taught school imbib thi mawkish strain
condorcet filter dreg pain
each pert adept disown briton part
and pluck name england heart
what shall name word sound control
Th aspir thought cramp th expans soul
shall one halfpeopl island rocki round
A love glow creation bound
and social chariti contract plan

No th extend globe feel run
As broad gener th unbound sun
No narrow bigot reason view
thi interest england rank thine peru
franc door seek danger nigh
but heav turkey woe th imparti sigh
A steadi patriot world alon
the friend everi countri
next come gentler virtue Ah bewar
lest harsh vers shrink soft scare
visit roughli warm sigh
breath lip teardrop gem eye
sweet sensibl dwell inshrin
In fine fold feel mind
with delic mimosa sens endu
who shrink instinct hand rude
Or like anagilli prescient flower

sweet child sickli fanci yore
from love franc rousseau exil bore
and midst lake mountain wild ran
full shun haunt man
taught oer lone vale alpin steep
To lisp stori wrong weep
taught cherish still either eye
Of tender tear plenti suppli
and pour brook babbl
taught nice scale mete feel strong
fals degre exquisit wrong
for crush beetl first widow dove
and warbl sorrow grove
next poor suffer guilt last
for parent friend king countri fall

mark fair votari prodig grief
with cureless pang woe mock relief
droop soft sorrow oer fade flower
oer dead jackass pour pearli shower
but hear unmov loir ensanguin flood
choke slain lyon drench blood
Of crime blot age world shame

Of talent honour virtu wit forlorn
In friendless exil wise good

Of savag cruelti scare mind

Of heart torn reek mangl breast
