poem BY
robert loui stevenson


autumn fire

In garden
and vale
from autumn bonfir
see smoke trail

pleasant summer
and summer flower
the red fire blaze
the grey smoke tower

sing song season
someth bright
flower summer
fire fall


the unseen playmat

when children play alon green
In come playmat never seen
when children happi lone good
the friend children come wood

nobodi heard nobodi saw
hi pictur never could draw
but sure present abroad home
when children happi play alon

He lie laurel run grass
He sing tinkl music glass
whene happi tell
the friend children sure

He love littl hate big
T inhabit cave dig
T play soldier tin
that side frenchmen never win

T night go bed
bid go sleep troubl head
for wherev re lie cupboard shelf
T take care playth


the land OF storybook

At even lamp lit
around fire parent sit
they sit home talk sing
and play anyth

now littl gun crawl
all dark along wall
and follow round forest track
away behind sofa back

there night none spi
all hunter camp lie
and play book read
till time go bed

these hill wood
these starri solitud
and river whose brink
the roar lion come drink

see other far away
As firelit camp lay
and like indian scout
around parti prowl

So nurs come
home return across sea
and go bed backward look
At dear land storybook


the wind

saw toss kite high
and blow bird sky
and around heard pass
like ladi skirt across grass
O wind ablow day long
O wind sing loud song

saw differ thing
but alway hid
felt push heard call
could see
O wind ablow day long
O wind sing loud song

O strong cold
O blower young old
are beast field tree
Or stronger child
O wind ablow day long
O wind sing loud song


wintertim

late lie wintri sun ab
A frosti fieri sleepyhead
blink hour two
A bloodr orang set

befor star left sky
At morn dark rise
and shiver naked
By cold candl bath dress

close jolli fire sit
To warm frozen bone bit
Or reindeersl explor
the colder countri round door

when go nurs doth wrap
Me comfort cap
the cold wind burn face blow
it frosti pepper nose

black step silver sod
thick blow frosti breath abroad
and tree hous hill lake
are frost like weddingcak


pirat stori

three us afloat meadow swing
three us aboard basket lea
wind air blow spring
and wave meadow like wave sea

where shall adventur today re afloat
wari weather steer star
shall africa asteer boat
To provid babylon malabar

Hi squadron arow sea
cattl meadow acharg roar
quick ll escap re mad
the wicket harbour garden shore

Of music brain

Do let dreamer weep

and sing soft low

A life lesson

and glad wild way
Of schoolgirl day

but life love soon come
there littl girl nt cri

there littl girl nt cri
they broken heart know
and rainbow gleam
Of youth dream
are thing long ago
but heaven hold sigh
there littl girl nt cri

they went sea siev
In siev went sea
In spite friend could say
On winter morn stormi day
In siev went sea
and siev turn round round
and everi one cri you ll drown
they call aloud our siev ai nt big
but nt care button nt care fig
In siev ll go sea
far far

their head green hand blue

To small tobaccopip mast
and everi one said saw go
Oh wo nt soon upset know
for sky dark voyag long
and happen may extrem wrong
In siev sail fast
far far
are land jumbl live
their head green hand blue
and went sea siev

the water soon came

So keep dri wrap feet
In pinki paper fold neat
and fasten pin
and pass night crockeryjar
and said how wise
though sky dark voyag long
yet never think rash wrong
while round siev spin
far far
are land jumbl live
their head green hand blue
and went sea siev

and night long sail away
and sun went
they whistl warbl mooni song
To echo sound copperi gong
In shade mountain brown
O timballoo how happi
when live siev crockeryjar
and night long moonlight pale
We sail away peagreen sail
In shade mountain brown

are land jumbl live
their head green hand blue
and went sea siev

they sail western sea
To land cover tree
and bought owl use cart
and pound rice cranberrytart
and hive silveri bee
and bought pig green jackdaw
and love monkey lollipop paw
and forti bottl ringbore
and end stilton chees

their head green hand blue
and went sea siev

and twenti year came back
In twenti year
and everi one said how tall ve grown
for ve lake torribl zone
and hill chankli bore
and drank health gave feast
Of dumpl made beauti yeast
and everi one said If live
We go sea siev
To hill chankli bore
far far
are land jumbl live
their head green hand blue
and went sea siev





poem BY henri W longfellow


the emperor S birdsnest

onc emperor charl spain
with swarthi grave command
forget campaign
long besieg mud rain
some old frontier town flander

Up dreari camp
In great boot spanish leather
stride measur tramp
these hidalgo dull damp
curs frenchmen curs weather

thu fro went
over upland hollow
give impati vent
perch upon emperor tent
In nest spi swallow

ye swallow nest
built clay hair hors
mane tail dragoon crest
found hedgerow east west
after skirmish forc

then old hidalgo said
As twirl gray mustachio
sure swallow overhead
think emperor tent shed
and emperor macho

hear imperi name
coupl word malic
half anger half shame
forth great campaign came
slowli canva palac

let hand bird molest
said solemnli hurt
ad way jest
golondrina guest
T wife desert

swift bowstr speed shaft
through camp spread rumor
and soldier quaf
flemish beer dinner laugh
At emperor pleasant humor

So unharm unafraid
sat swallow still brood
till constant cannonad
through wall breach made
and sieg thu conclud

then armi elsewher bent
struck tent disband
onli emperor tent
for order ere went
veri curtli leav stand

So stood alon
loos flap torn tatter
till brood fledg flown
sing oer wall stone
which cannonshot shatter


the raini day

the day cold dark dreari
It rain wind never weari
the vine still cling moulder wall
but everi gust dead leav fall
and day dark dreari

My life cold dark dreari
It rain wind never weari
My thought still cling moulder past
but hope youth fall thick blast
and day dark dreari

Be still sad heart ceas repin
behind cloud sun still shine
thi fate common fate
into life rain must fall
some day must dark dreari


AN april day

when warm sun bring
seedtim harvest return
T sweet visit still wood spring
the first flower plain

love season well
when forest glade teem bright form
nor dark manyfold cloud foretel
the comingon storm

from earth loosen mould
the sapl draw susten thrive
though stricken heart winter cold
the droop tree reviv

the softlywarbl song
come pleasant wood color wing
glanc quick bright sun move along
the forest open

when bright sunset fill
the silver wood light green slope throw
it shadow hollow hill
and wide upland glow

and eve born
In blue lake sky oerreach far
Is hollow moon dip horn
and twinkl mani star

invert tide
stand gray rock trembl shadow throw
and fair tree look side side
and see

sweet april mani thought
Is wed unto thee heart wed
nor shall fail till autumn brought
life golden fruit shed


rain IN summer

how beauti rain
after dust heat
In broad fieri street
In narrow lane
how beauti rain

how clatter along roof
like tramp hoof
how gush struggl
from throat overflow spout

across window pane
It pour pour
and swift wide
with muddi tide
like river gutter roar
the rain welcom rain

In countri everi side
where far wide
like leopard tawni spot hide
stretch plain
To dri grass drier grain
how welcom rain


daybreak

A wind came sea
and said O mist make room

It hail ship cri sail
Ye marin night gone

and hurri landward far away
cri awak day

It said unto forest shout
hang leafi banner

It touch woodbird fold wing
and said O bird awak sing

and oer farm O chanticl
your clarion blow day near

It whisper field corn
bow hail come morn

It shout belfri tower
awak O bell proclaim hour

It cross churchyard sigh
and said not yet quiet lie


afternoon IN februari

the day end
the night descend
the marsh frozen
the river dead

through cloud like ash
the red sun flash
On villag window
that glimmer red

the snow recomm
the buri fenc
mark longer
the road oer plain

while meadow
like fear shadow
slowli pass
A funer train

the bell peal
and everi feel
within respond
To dismal knell

shadow trail
My heart bewail
and toll within
like funer bell


hiawatha S fish

On shine bigseawat
with fishinglin cedar
Of twist bark cedar
forth catch sturgeon nahma
mishenahma king fish
In birch cano exult
all alon went hiawatha

through clear transpar water
He could see fish swim
far depth
see yellow perch sahwa

like sunbeam water
see shawgashe crawfish
like spider bottom
On white sandi bottom

At stern sat hiawatha
with fishinglin cedar
In plume breez morn
play hemlock branch
On bow tail erect
sat squirrel adjidaumo
In fur breez morn
play prairi grass

On white sand bottom
lay monster mishenahma
lay sturgeon king fish
through gill breath water
with fin fan winnow
with tail swept sandfloor

there lay armor
On side shield guard
plate bone upon forehead
down side back shoulder

and lay bottom

As hiawatha
In birch cano came sail
with fishinglin cedar

In finger hiawatha
felt loos line jerk tighten
As drew tug
that birch cano stood endwis
like birch log water
with squirrel adjidaumo

full scorn hiawatha
when saw fish rise upward
saw pike maskenozha
come nearer nearer
and shout water
esa esa shame upon

reel downward bottom
sank pike great confus
and mighti sturgeon nahma

To bream scale crimson

made whirlpool water
whirl birch cano circl
round round gurgl eddi

slowli downward waver gleam
sank ugudwash sunfish
and sturgeon nahma
heard shout hiawatha
heard challeng defianc
the unnecessari tumult
ring far across water

from white sand bottom
Up rose angri gestur

In wrath dart upward

open great jaw swallow
both cano hiawatha

down darksom cavern
plung headlong hiawatha

grope helpless wonder
till felt great heart beat

and smote anger
with fist heart nahma
felt mighti king fish

and squirrel adjidaumo

then said hiawatha
O littl friend squirrel

and sturgeon nahma

then still drift landward
till grate pebbl

heard grate upon margin
felt strand upon pebbl

then heard clang flap
As mani wing assembl
heard scream confus
As bird prey contend

Of kayoshk seagul peer

In bodi sturgeon

and make oil us winter

and wait till sun set

till kayoshk sate seagul
from banquet rose clamor
and across fieri sunset

To nest among rush

To sleep went hiawatha
and nokomi labor

and kayoshk hungri seagul

three whole day night altern

till seagul came longer
and upon sand lay noth

poem BY william wordsworth


TO A butterfli

ve watch full half hour
selfpois upon yellow flower
and littl butterfli inde
know sleep feed
how motionless frozen sea
more motionless
what joy await breez
hath found among tree

My tree sister flower

come often us fear wrong
sit near us bough
We ll talk sunshin song
and summer day young
sweet childish day long
As twenti day


the rainbow

My heart leap behold
A rainbow sky
So life began
So man
So shall grow old
Or let die
the child father man
and could wish day
bound natur pieti


WE are seven

A simpl child
that lightli draw breath
and feel life everi limb
what know death

met littl cottag girl
she eight year old said
her hair thick mani curl
that cluster round head

she rustic woodland air
and wildli clad
her eye fair fair
her beauti made glad

sister brother littl maid

how mani seven said
and wonder look

and pray tell
she answer seven
and two us conway dwell
and two gone sea

two us churchyard lie
My sister brother
and churchyard cottag
dwell near mother

you say two conway dwell
and two gone sea
yet ye seven pray tell
sweet maid may

then littl maid repli
seven boy girl
two us churchyard lie
beneath churchyard tree

you run littl maid
your limb aliv
If two churchyard laid
then ye five

their grave green may seen
the littl maid repli
twelv step mother door
and side side

My stock often knit
My kerchief hem
and upon ground sit
and sing song

and often sunset sir
when light fair
take littl porring
and eat supper

the first die sister jane
In bed moan lay
till god releas pain
and went away

So churchyard laid
and grass dri
togeth round grave play
My brother john

and ground white snow
and could run slide
My brother john forc go
and lie side

how mani said
If two heaven
quick littl maid repli
O master seven

but dead two dead
their spirit heaven
T throw word away still
the littl maid would
and said nay seven

and gottlieb sat dream
when happi fanci

In child poor trembl hand

you may think sore puzzl

So went burgomast
As wisest man knew

and open letter
they stood almost dismay
that littl child dare
To ask lord aid

then burgomast stammer
and scarc knew speak
and hastili brush asid
A drop like tear cheek

then spoke right gruffli
and turn
thi must foolish boy
and small one doubt

but six rosi children
that night press
poor trust littl gottlieb
stood near rest

and heard simpl touch prayer
through noisi play
though tri best put
the thought away

A wise learn man
men call good
but wisdom seem like foolish
By weak child simpl trust

now morn christma came
and long long week done
poor gottlieb scarc could sleep
rose sun

and hasten mother
but scarc might speak fear
when saw wonder look saw
the burgomast near

He nt afraid holi babe
nor mother meek mild
but felt great man
had never child

amaz poor child look find
the hearth pile wood
and tabl never full
wa heap dainti food

then half hide truth
the burgomast said
while mother bless knee
and gottlieb shook dread

nay give thank good dame
To aid
Be grate littl son
and lord pray

then turn round gottlieb
your written prayer see
came address
It came

T foolish thing

and overcom fight

three fisher went sail away west
away west sun went
each thought woman love best
and children stood watch town
for men must work women must weep
and littl earn mani keep
though harbor bar moan

three wive sat lighthous tower
and trimm d lamp sun went
they look d squall look d shower
and nightrack came roll rag brown
but men must work women must weep
though storm sudden water deep
and harbor bar moan

three corps lay shine sand
In morn gleam tide went
and women weep wring hand
for never come home town
for men must work women must weep
and sooner sooner sleep
and goodby bar moan


the old old song

when world young lad
and tree green
and everi goos swan lad
and everi lass queen
then hey boot hors lad
and round world away

and everi dog day

when world old lad

and sport stale lad
and wheel run
creep home take place
the spent maim among

Be good sweet maid let clever
Do nobl thing dream day long
and make life death vast forev
one grand sweet song


the lost doll

sweet littl doll dear
the prettiest doll world
her cheek red white dear
and hair charmingli curl
but lost poor littl doll dear
As play heath one day
and cri week dear
but never could find lay

found poor littl doll dear
As play heath one day
folk say terribl chang dear
for paint wash away
and arm trodden cow dear
and hair least bit curl
yet old sake sake still dear
the prettiest doll world

down TO sleep

novemb wood bare still
novemb day clear bright
each noon burn morn chill
the morn snow gone night
each day step grow slow grow light
As wood rever creep
watch thing lie sleep

never knew bed
fragrant smell soft touch
the forest sift shape spread
never knew much
Of human sound
low tone forest sweep
when wild thing lie sleep

each day find new coverlid
tuck sweet eye shut tight
sometim viewless mother bid
her fern kneel full sight
hear choru goodnight
and half smile half weep
listen lie sleep

novemb wood bare still
novemb day bright good
life noon burn life morn chill
life night rest feet long stood
some warm soft bed field wood
the mother fail keep
where lay us sleep


septemb

the goldenrod yellow
the corn turn brown
the tree appl orchard
with fruit bend

the gentian bluest fring
are curl sun
In dusti pod milkwe
it hidden silk spun

the sedg flaunt harvest
In everi meadow nook
and aster brooksid
make aster brook

from dewi lane morn
the grape sweet odor rise
At noon road flutter
with yellow butterfli

By love token
septemb day
with summer best weather
and autumn best cheer


octob S bright blue weather

O sun sky cloud june
and flower june togeth
Ye rival one hour
octob bright blue weather

when loud bumblebe make hast
belat thriftless vagrant
and goldenrod die fast
and lane grape fragrant

when gentian roll fring tight
To save morn
and chestnut fall satin burr
without sound warn

when ground red appl lie
In pile like jewel shine
and redder still old stone wall
are leav woodbin twine

when love waysid thing
their whitewing seed sow
and field still green fair
late aftermath grow

when spring run low brook
In idl golden freight
bright leav sink noiseless hush
Of wood winter wait

when comrad seek sweet countri haunt
By two two togeth
and count like miser hour hour
octob bright blue weather

O sun sky flower june
count boast togeth
love loveth best year
octob bright blue weather





poem BY gabriel setoun


romanc

saw ship asail
asail sea
her mast shine gold
her deck ivori
and sail silk soft milk
and silver shroud

and round sail
the sea sparkl white
the wave clap hand sang
To see fair sight
they kiss twice kiss thrice
and murmur delight

then came gallant captain
and stood upon deck
In velvet coat ruffl white
without spot speck
and diamond ring tripl string
Of pearl around neck

and fourandtwenti sailor
were round bow low
On everi jacket three time three
gold button row
and cutlass knee
they made goodli show

and ship went sail
asail oer sea
she dive beyond set sun
but never back came
for found land golden sand
where pearl diamond


jack frost

the door shut door
befor went bed last night
yet jack frost got see
and left window silver white

He must wait till slept
and singl word spoke
but pencil oer pane crept
away woke

and see hill
nor field stretch beyond lane
but fairer thing
hi finger trace everi pane

rock castl tower high
hill dale stream field
and knight armor ride
with nod plume shine shield

and littl boat
big ship sail spread breez
and yonder palm tree wave fair
On island set silver sea

and butterfli gauzi wing
and herd cow flock sheep
and fruit flower thing
you see sound asleep

for creep softli underneath
the door light
jack frost take everi breath breath
and know thing think

He paint windowpan
In fairi line frozen steam
and wake see
the love thing saw dream


the world S music

the world happi place
where everi child danc sing
and alway smile face
and never sulk anyth

waken morn come
and feel air light aliv
with strang sweet music like hum
Of bee busi hive

the linnet play among leav
At hideandseek chirp sing
while flash eav
the swallow twitter wing

the twig shake bough sway
and tall old tree could climb
and wind come stay
are sing gaili time

from dawn dark old millwheel
make music go round round
and dustywhit flour meal
the miller whistl sound

and listen rain
where leav bird bee dumb
you hear patter pane
like andrew beat drum

the coal beneath kettl croon
and clap hand danc glee
and even kettl hum tune
To tell time tea

the world happi place
that children whether big small
should alway smile face
and never never sulk

the chestnut burr

A wee littl nut lay deep nest
Of satin brown softest best
and slept grew cradl rock
As hung bough interlock

thi littl nut grew ere long found
there work outsid soft green ground
It must part world might know
It tri one littl seed sow

and soon hous kept warm
wa toss autumn storm
the stem crack old hous fell
and chestnut burr empti shell

but littl nut wait lay
dream wonder dream one day
Of break coat brown

and spoke better cheer

Of faith never waxeth dim

the wind and the moon

said wind moon blow
you stare
In air
like ghost chair
alway look
hate watch ll blow

the wind blew hard went moon
So deep
On heap
Of cloud sleep
down lay wind slumber soon
mutter low ve done moon

He turn bed
On high
In sky
with one ghost eye
the moon shone white aliv plain
said wind blow

the wind blew hard moon grew dim
with sledg
and wedg
knock edg
If blow right fierc grim
the creatur soon dimmer dim

He blew blew thin thread
one puff
more enough
To blow snuff
one good puff last bred
and glimmer glimmer glum go thread

He blew great blast thread gone
In air
nowher
wa moonbeam bare
far harmless shi star shone
sure certain moon gone

the wind took revel
On
In town
like merrymad clown
He leap halloo whistl roar
what the glimmer thread

He flew rage danc blew
but vain
wa pain
Of burst brain
for still broader moonscrap grew
the broader swell big cheek blew

slowli grew till fill night
and shone
On throne
In sky alon
A matchless wonder silveri light
radiant love queen night

said wind what marvel power
with breath
good faith
blew death
first blew away right sky
then blew strength

but moon knew noth affair
for high
In sky
with one white eye
motionless mile air
she never heard great wind blare

more rapid eagl courser came
and whistl shout call name
now dasher dancer prancer vixen
On comet cupid donder blitzen
To top porch top wall
now dash away dash away dash away
As dri leav wild hurrican fli
when meet obstacl mount sky
So housetop courser flew
with sleigh full toy st nichola
and twinkl heard roof
the pranc paw littl hoof
As drew head turn around
down chimney st nichola came bound
He dress fur head foot
and cloth tarnish ash soot
A bundl toy flung back
and look like peddler open pack
hi eye twinkl dimpl merri
hi cheek like rose nose like cherri
hi droll littl mouth drawn like bow
and beard chin white snow
the stump pipe held tight teeth
and smoke encircl head like wreath
He broad face littl round belli
that shook laugh like bowl full jelli
He chubbi plump right jolli old elf
and laugh saw spite
A wink eye twist head
soon gave know noth dread
He spoke word went straight work
and fill stock turn jerk
and lay finger asid nose
and give nod chimney rose
He sprang sleigh team gave whistl
and away flew like thistl
but heard exclaim ere drove sight
happi christma goodnight

hunt song

Up ye dame lass gay
To meadow trip away
T must tend flock morn
and scare small bird corn
not soul home may stay
for shepherd must go
with lanc bow
To hunt wolf wood today

leav hearth leav hous
To cricket mous
find grannam sunni seat
with babe lambkin feet
not soul home may stay
for shepherd must go
with lanc bow
To hunt wolf wood today
samuel T coleridge

king solomon and the bee
A tale talmud

when solomon reign glori
unto throne queen sheba came
So talmud may read stori
drawn magic monarch fame
To see splendor court bring
some fit tribut mighti king

nor alon much high heard
what flower learn grace royal speech
what gem wisdom drop everi word
what wholesom lesson wont teach
In pleas proverb wish sooth
To know rumor spoke simpl truth

besid queen heard piqu
how deepest riddl could spi
how curiou art women boast
were quit transpar pierc eye
and queen come royal guest
To put sage cun test

and straight held monarch view
In either hand radiant wreath flower
the one bedeck everi charm hue
wa newli cull natur choicest bower
the less fair everi part
wa rare product divinest art

which true fals said
great solomon silent allamaz
each wonder courtier shook puzzl head
while garland long monarch gaze
As one see miracl fain
for raptur neer would speak

which true woman ask

So wise head hardli task
most learn lieg trivial thing
but still sage silent plain
A deepen doubt perplex royal brain

while thu ponder present see
hard casement stori goe
A littl band busi bustl bee
hunt honey wither rose
the monarch smile rais royal head
open window said

the window open king command
within room eager insect flew
and sought flower sheba dexter hand
and king courtier knew
that wreath natur baffl queen
return tell wonder seen

My stori teach everi tale bear
A fit moral wise may find
In trifl light atom air
some use lesson enrich mind
some truth design profit pleas

A tragic stori

there live sage day yore
and handsom pigtail wore
but wonder much sorrow
becaus hung behind

He muse upon curiou case
and swore d chang pigtail place
and hang face

He turn round
but still hung behind

then round round
all day puzzl sage spin
In vain matter pin
the pigtail hung behind

and right left round
and
He turn still pigtail stout
hung steadili behind

and though effort never slack
and though twist twirl tack
ala still faith back
