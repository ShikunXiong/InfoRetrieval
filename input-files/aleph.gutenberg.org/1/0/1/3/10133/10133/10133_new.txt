In whisper foreign tongu

and merri day young

beneath dawn bough
heard aris go
and heart ach

whi two depart
befor could understand
where lie land O heart
O heart lie land

from farm farm
furtiv came
In either home hearth warm
We nurs hungrier flame

our feet foul mire
our face blind mist
but night nake fire
about us kiss d

To farm farm
loath return
pale beneath gallow arm
the planet saturn burn



derelict


oer tear shed dear
the bitter vine twist
and hawk red deer
they keep kiss d
all broken lie shiel
that shelter rain
with star pierc ceil
and dawn empti pane

thro mist moorway
fade hunter pack
from ridg thi doorway
happi voic float back
O thread mist love
reach hand hous
onli mind kiss d love
and forget broken vow

when winter tree bestrew path
still twig leaf twain
will cling weep winter wrath
but foreknown forlorn pain
To fall green leav come again

watch d sleep furrow
the first fell fight
hi grave would dig tomorrow
the battl call tonight

they bore asid tree
By undigg d grave content
To lie back eas
and hark battl went

the battl went villag
and back night born
far cri murder pillag
with smoke stand corn

but came morrow
they talk d task
As listen d furrow
for dead mouth could ask

how went battl brother
but never know
for mouth red earth smother
As shoulder spade go

yet sleep thereund
but ever must toss turn
how went battl wonder
and never learn

when winter tree bestrew path
still twig leaf twain
will cling weep winter wrath
but foreknown forlorn pain
To fall green leav come

Of fame sick blood
but think badajoz
and yet god good

beyond sack town
reach pluck ae lilyfloo r
where leader press crown

O mari lili bow d wet
with mair mornin rain

and damn d bitter drouth

OF three children

OF three children choos
A chaplet OF vers


you burd blith
burd blith
the mower would whet scyth
befor dew dri

and woke soon woke soon
and drew nurseri blind
all wonder wane moon
with small june rose twine
low cradl swung moon
with elfin dawn behind

In whisper elder slept
We knelt said prayer
and dress d us tipto crept
adown creak stair

the world possessor lay abe
and world
nay nay hark mower tread
and must save flower

the mower knew rest hast
that old unweari man
but young We paus race
and gather d ran

O youth careless youth fleet
with heart wing bird
the lark flew beneath feet
To cops pheasant whirr d

the cattl darkl lair
heav stretch d
almost trod unawar
upon busi elv

that dropp d spool gossam
To dangl dri
and scurri home hollow fir
where white owl wink eye

nor burd blith
had driven hast
but old old man lean lith
that afar behind us pace
So lean lith shoulder d scyth
and whetston waist

within gate grassi round
whenc earliest flown
He upsidedown d scyth ground
it edg care hone
but heed heard sound
for world alon
the world bound
the conquer sun upshon

and level ray
We stood eye screen
the world yesterday
our homeli world
So grey goldengreen lay
all quiet sheen
that wove gold grey
the grey green
sure never hand puck wand
Of mab fairi queen
nor princ peer fairyland
had power weav wide riband
Of grey gold green

but god greec
and walk mead along
the great authent god yore
that haunt earth shore shore
trail robe song

and sandal d foot brush d
and scarf hem
the flower awok sleep rush d
like children

pellmel pour vale stream
By lawn steepi brae
O children children dream
your flower run away

but afar abe sleepili
the children heard us call
and burd blith
must gather

the meadowsweet besid hedg
the dogros vetch
the sword iri mid sedg
the mallow ditch

with wimpl burn
where midg danc reel
with watermint ladi fern
We brimm d wicker creel

till heavili weigh d
On bank flung us
shook treasur neath shade
and wove tripl crown

flower flower
the noonday heat dri
and dear yet could bear
A loveli cheek besid
and perfect past compar
Ah darl world care
It cost us decid

natheless sang sweet accord
each bend oer brede
O flower oxenford
and flower north tweed
and flower earthli sward
that owe mortal seed

and brightest wove

and holi peac angel love
glad hope gentl ruth
Ah bind fast tripl twine
Of memori wild woodbin
that still human stay divin
and alon age youth

but hark look warn rook

Ah sister look what field

what hand cut coppic
and thro trimm d ruin d tree

T time t time done crime
and laid meadow wast
the bent unweari tyrant time
that know rest hast

yet courag children homeward bring
your heart garland high
for dare thing
that shall worst defi

We nail dial hand
We bind sun
By gibeon stay stand
Or moon oer ajalon

We blunt th abhor shear
nor shift skein fate
nor say unto post year
Ye shall desol

We cage lion rage
nor teach turtledov
besid well moan tell
Or haunt one grove
but lion brood rang food
As fledg bird rove

and east west three may wend
yet wreath wound

Be east west neer far
In east west shall peep star
No blossom break ground

epilogu

TO A mother ON see her smile repeat
IN her daughter S eye


A thousand song might made
Of you you
A thousand thousand tongu fire
that trembl golden wire
To lamp night star braid
the morn bough dew

within greenwood girl boy
had loiter d lure
and men citi close book
To dream spring run brook
and ever joy
for manhood abjur

and d made strong strong
outlast tower town
millenni shepherd neath thorn
had pipe world reborn
and danc delight dale along
and daisi down

A thousand song might made
but requir
content reign littl
ere abdic smile
you pass d shade shade
immort forgot
