nave  ascenden unam navem quae erat simoni  dixit
ad simonem duc altum et laxat retia vestra capturam
Et cum hoc feciss concluserunt piscium multitudinem
copiosam  Et impleverunt amba navicula ita ut mergerentur
quod cum videret simon petru procidit ad genua jesu
stupor enim circumdederat eum  similit autem jacobum
