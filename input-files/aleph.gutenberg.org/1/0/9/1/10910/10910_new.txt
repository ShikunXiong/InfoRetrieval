robert loui stevenson

AN elegi

high patmo southern sea
our northern dreamer sleep
strang star grave
strang leav wing tropic splendour wave
while far beneath mile shimmer mile
the great pacif faeri deep
smile day long silken secret smile

son race nomad find still
it home region furthest home
rang untir border world
and rest roam
love land make boast
the birthright blood came
heir light guard scottish coast
and care filial fame
proud poet scotsman
and bore scottish name

death long sought poet find last
death pursu land sea
not flight fear heart aghast
with stoni dread immort
He fled not cowardli
fled captain whose shape hand
lie moment fortun land
shed vainglori blood upon field
death last find treasur isl
and pirat hidden hoard
life t ship sail seek
and death pilot come aboard
methink see smile boy glad smile
On madden wind water reef unknown
As thunder sail dread typhoon
and surf shudder timber groan
horror ahead death besid wheel
then spread still broad lagoon
and lap water round rest keel

strang isl voic must ask vain
In vain beseech win answer word
save mock echo lone pain
from lone hill bird
island beneath whose unrel coast
As though never sun
the whole world treasur lieth sunk lost
unsun unseen
for either sunk beyond diver skill
there fathom deep gold arust
Or island hoard still
yea said within thi dread wall
there folk know death
the love lost lost love
will kind voic make answer cri
give ach heart littl trust
show t good live best die
some voic know
whither dead man goe
We hear music side
mayb littl tap door
A someth call someth sigh
No
O voic valiantli declar
the best news true
then happi island happi dead
how gladli would spread
impati sail

O vanish loveli flower face
treasur hair great immort eye
are safe secret place
and true beauti never die
soldier saint haughti love name
women set whole wide world flame
poet sang passion sky
and lover wild wise
fought pray poor flit gleam
wa love worship dream
Is love lie fame inde breath
and sure thing life death
Or may within guard shore
He meet her shall meet
till kind death fold neath shadowi wing
she within heart softli tell
that dead love well
He immort master sing

immort yea dare word
If aught remaineth mortal day
that written shall remain
that sung built aye
face must fade golden look
unless poet eternalis
make live golden look golden book
death soon late quench brightest eye
T written never die
yea memori guard like sacr gold
some saint face also must grow old
pass forget think darest thou
On beauti quit forgot

strang craft word strang magic pen
wherebi dead still talk live men
wherebi sentenc trivial scope
may centr love hope
and couplet like rosebud furl
lie wist wonder world

old star yet still endur
old flower yet never fail spring
whi song old new
known yet strang sweet small shape hue
how may poet thu ever sing
thu build climb music sweet sure
As build star flower etern mind
Ah poet seek find
yea magisteri skill wherebi
god put heaven woman eye
natur mighti mysteri art
that know pack whole within part
the shell hum music sea
the littl word big etern
the cosmic rhythm microcosm thing
one song lark one planet sing
one kind heart beat warm bird tree
To hear beat knew well

virgil prose far distant day
when mention heartfelt name
shall shake head men oblivi say
we know master fame
not swift forget wrought
day upon day rapt fastidi pen
turn like preciou stone anxiou thought
thi word yet
seek match mean world
nor morn star gave ear attent
that inde might ever dare
with prais immort
unworthili content

not boy still whistl earth
not singl human heart beat true
not love last honour brave
ha earth grave
O wellbelov




AN ode TO spring

TO grant and nelli allen

Is spring
Or bird wrong
that play flute viol
A thousand strong
In minstrel galleri
Of long deep wood
epiphani
Of bloom bud

grave minstrel
Of deep respons chant
but see yonder goe
dewdrunk giddi slant
yon shelleylark
and hark
him giddi brink
Of pearli heaven
hi fairi anvil clink

Or watch fanci
how brim note
fall like string pearl
from heavenli throat
Or like fountain
In hesperid
rain silver rain
In gleam chime
On back ivori girl
twice happi rhyme

Ah none
may make plain
No imag may seek
shall match magic gurgl beak

and mani silli thing
that hop cheep
and perk tini tail
and sideway peep
and flitter littl wing
seem consequenti way
To tell spring

the river warbl soft run
with fuller curv sleeker line
though winterblacken hedg
twig unbud iron shine
and trampl still river sedg

and O sun
friend gener sun
that come meet big warm hand
and O ski
there maid true
Is half chast
As pure kiss green willow wand
against intens pale blue
Of sweet boundless overarch wast

and see dear heaven spring
see yonder yonder river
long glitter pearli finger flash
upon warm bright air
whi t heavenli palm
the christian tree
whose bud psalm
Of natur pieti
soft silver notch smooth green stem
Ah spring must follow
It spring

O spirit spring
whose strang instinct art
make bird sing
and bring bud
O heart
take thi heavenli reign
and deep
draw hidden flower
and sleep
throughout winter long
O sweet mysteri power
awak sloth song

TO john lane

vast mysteri brother ere yet
So much men may pois upon needl end
still shook laughter monstrou might thee
and still haughti crest call morn friend

thi lattic column jet bright blue air
tall mast stronger tower
three hundr winter beheld thee mighti
befor littl life live one littl hour

with rocki foot sternset like iron land
with leafi rustl crest morn sow pearl
huge minster half heaven men saw thee stand
thi rug girth waist fifti eastern girl

knot wart slab armour like hide
Of tropic eleph unstorm steep
As grim fortress princesspearl insid
where savag guardian face beard bastion keep

So hard rind old tree shield soft heart
A woman heart tender littl nestl leav
nor rind hard touch soft part
and spring first babybud easi passag cleav

pictur thee within dainti satin side
where long day sleep dryad dream
but moon bend low tap thee thrice glide
know fairi knock bask within beam

and long night eye ear
she sway within thine arm sing fairi tune
till startl dawn softli disappear
and sleep dream rise moon

but peep day great band heavenli bird
fill thi branchi chamber thousand flute
and torrid noon stroll weari herd
To seek thi friendli shade doze thi root

till set sun turn home
and ere moon dawn brief enchant space
weari million mile soresp starbeam come
and moth bat hold witch sabbath place

and pictur thee bloodstain holyrood
dread haunt palac bat owl whenc steal
shroud day lost murder spirit wood
and fright young happi nest homeless hoot squeal

then mayb dangl thi gloomi gallow bough
A human corps swing mourn rattl bone chain
hi eighteenth centuri flesh hath fatten nineteenth centuri cow
ghastli aeolian harp finger wind rain

poor rizpah come reap newlyfallen bone
that thrill soft littl limb within womb
and mark yon alchemist zodiacspangl zone
wrench mandrak root fatten gloom

So round thi day maiden morn haunt night
from lark sunlit dream owl gibber ghost
A catacomb dark maze live light
To wide sea air green welcom coast

seek god old tree accept worship thou
all god fail alway need
hang votiv song beneath thi templ bough
unto thi strength cri old monster creed

give clasp earth feed root like thine
To mount yon heaven staraspir head
fill full sap bud shrunken life mine
and bough oh might stalwart son shed

with love cheek press close thi horni breast
hear roar sap mount within thi vein
tingl bud thi great hand open toward west
To catch sweetheart wind bring sister rain

O wind blow fruit mouth god
O rain softli fall hi alllov eye
you bring bud tree daisi sod
O god best angel spring aris




A ballad OF london

TO H W massinsham

Ah london london delight
great flower open night
great citi midnight sun
whose day begin day done

lamp lamp sky
open sudden beam eye
leap alight either hand

like dragonfli hansom hover
with jewel eye catch lover
the street full light love
soft gown flutter soil dove

the human moth light
dash cling close daze delight
and burn laugh world wife
for london life

upon thi petal butterfli
but thi root say lie
A world weep trodden thing
poor worm eye wing

from corrupt woe
spring bright flower charm us
men die rot deep sight
To keep jungleflow bright

pari london worldflow twain
wherewith worldtre bloom
sinc time hath gather babylon
and wither rome still wither

sidon tyre ye

for thee etern night
and circ pari hath charm
To stay time unrel arm

time moth shall eat
your chime tower proud tall
He shall utterli abas
and set desert place




pari day BY day A familiar epistl

TO mrs henri harland

pari half angel half grisett
would thee yet

stretch starri lamp heaven
and whisper thousand tree
vagu hint hesperid

onc heart sit
with alin smile harri wit
To sit sip cloudi green
with dreami hint speech

Or may flash intent
At call stern argument
when new woman fain would
like old male husband free
the proseman take mighti lyre
and talk like music set fire

the merri crowd slip
glitter glanc eye
all happi lover way
To make golden end day
Ah cafe truli call la paix

Or pension would
with transatlant maiden three
the vow old
guard song tree gold

O ladi ladi visavis

On whose fair head golden fleec

Oh athen eer depart
come back come back bring heart

and whose gentl silver grace
So wise speech kind face
whose everi wise witti word

Th aveng goddess sex

and wring tear sigh

Ah furi fascin fair

pari half angel half grisett
would thee yet
but london wait like wife
london love whole life

tell pari merci
how flirt dear thee

great man song whose gloriou laurel head
within lap death sleep well last
down dark road seek deathless dead

No sing spray born

No goldhair guardian maiden stand
No appl ripen reach
and none mad land

In hurri transit fro

So loos thi shallop hold
and trust ancient chart

cor cordium


O golden day O silver night

O golden day O silver night
that brought true love last
Ah wilt thou drop sight
and drown within past

one wave life wide sea
one littl nameless crest foam
the day gave

nay rather morn grow
In flush gleam kingli ray
while heaven sungod goe
So shall ascend day

and last long night near
and love grow angel gloam
nay sweetheart fear tear
the star shall see us home




love S exchang

simpl care whit
for pelf place
It enough sit
and watch dulcinea face
To mark light shadow flit
across silver moon

merchandis
No stock share
No gold lie
In deep eye

It would bank within eye

buy smile day
with love
and sell back costpric say
A kiss two

the world mani thing t true
To fill time

To seek newer home

but ere spread foolish wing

sometim idl heart would sail

To tempt less pacif gale
and ocean far away
but ere shake foolish wing
heart stay home wise love wisdom sing

It seem sweet burn die
that wondrou light within
but ere burn foolish wing

and dread trial love

My one poor hope meet thee
If death love god great purpos kind

Oh love day heavenli stair
A wild ecstat moment stand
and hungri eye hair

and hear instead welcom heaven
ah hadst thou true man
born high pang high soul must bear
nor fled low nepenth pain

To live though still guard eye

A mystic glee joyou awe

Or still great eye

AN inscript

Of spikenard master sake
but ah held nought half dear
As sweet dust whiten
the greater wonder shall say
To make white soul clay
from clay win face fair
those strang great eye sunlit hair
arippl oer witti brain
Or turn back dust

who know happi hour
the god whose strang alchem power
wrought dust may turn
To woman immort urn




song

she somewher sunlight strong
her tear fall rain
she call wind soft song
and flower come

yon bird messeng

yea sun moon sent
and everi wist wait star
