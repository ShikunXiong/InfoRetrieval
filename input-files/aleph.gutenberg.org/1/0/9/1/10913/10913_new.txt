and thee strang green flower spring
from daisi root seem bear sting

thou helicon number undefil
forgiv neath shadow thi name

not singer child



paolo and francesca


To rk leather
juli th

paolo and francesca

It happen great italian land
where everi bosom heateth star
At rimini anigh crumbl strand
the adriat filcheth near far
In past dant dreamday
that one francesca gave youth gold
unto age carl bolt bar
though love great young heart hold
how could give love unto miser old

nay young paolo happi lad
A youth dream eye yet dauntless foot
who francesca wealth love
one brave scale wall steal fruit
nor fear dotard own root
yea one wore love like sword thigh
and kept valour lute
one could dare well sing sigh
Ah heart love long gone

Ye lilyw happi nest
whose joy within gate duti spring
blame love poor would blest
must steal come marriag ring
Ye piti poor lark whose scarcetri wing
faint net still morn air
with brown free throat brethren sing
and ye piti
whose youth lark lost sing

In opportun dearbought joy
rich twain old lanciotto
who lord brother boy
and one home togeth dwelt three
with brother two besid
sat one board togeth one fane
their voic rose upon one hymn ah
beneath one roof night limb lain
As death share one etern pain

As much common men love flower
unto lanciotto francesca dear
T love wield jealou power
and therefor paolo move fear
though green youth sere
nor yet inde wrong hidden thing
grew heart unknown year
two egg still silent nest spring
may draw near june yet time sing

yet oft inde day gave sign
had francesca turn read
paolo bright eye dare shine
On dear gold glorifi head
ere light circl fled
and grey honour darken face
they come june noth said
day follow day even pace
nor night succeed night left starri trace

Or sure flower paolo press
In sweet volum put
told mistress drew breast
and call upon name none nigh
had scarf kiss piteou cri
but breath secret unto
Or one everi littl sigh
each left love true messeng
they sure kept winter year

yea love lay hush wait like seed
some laggard season still abe
though sun call gentl zephyr plead
and hope wait long must deem dead
yet lo tomorrow see shine head
sing dawn mid garden throng
Ah known earlier sped
wa fear day slept long
Or dream sing sweeter song

but poor flower symbol might
and magnitud great love thee
Ah aught imag thee aright
In earth heaven great fair
We watch acorn grow tree
We watch patient spark surpris mine
but oak thi ygdrasiltre
what mad mine convuls strength thine
that wreck world bid heaven soar steepl shine

A god hath earthli metaphor
A blind word hath earthli rhyme
love call name
As great lone thunder roll sublim
As great sun doth solitari climb
and know
just love stand stranger amid time
the god great voic speak high
We pray what art thou lord win us repli

So dark grew love fear flower
dream never spake word
burn like prison fire hour hour
sang dear song like unheed bird
wait summon voic long unheard
wait weari eye graciou sign
To bring rose tell dream dare
the tremul moment star shine
and ask answer
thine

winter today lo tomorrow spring
they wait long oh last came
came silver hush even
francesca toy thread upon frame
hard young paolo read knight dame
that long ago love pass away
He way tell flame
she dare listen way
but even bliss lover poor

the world grew sweet wonder west
the read listen
and mani dream silken nest
stole like curl incens air
yet look dare
but lover kiss paradis
hi voic sank turn gaze
like young bird flutter ere fli
and lo shine angel call eye

then silenc sprang kiss like flame
and hung lost togeth around
the world chang
meadow sky littl flower sound
again earth grew holi ground
while silenc mount moon
infinit love throb strain bound
Of great kiss longdelay boon
grant inde last end ah soon

As great sob ful sea
fill throat void ach cave
till hollow trembl silent
press sweet weight softlylap wave
So kiss mighti lover glad brave
and sky sun gone
trembl night star gave
A firmament memori sun
So thrill thrill life great kiss done

but coward shame word say
In passion hour sudden ici clang
slew bright morn tarnish day
An iron bell light dark rang
she shut ear throstl sang
she dare hear littl innoc bird
and white flower made poor head hang
To white white curd
but alack alack she speak word

the pearli line yonder hill afar
within dawn mount lark sing
By great angel morn star
that love free fair fresh thing
that move glitter daylight spring
To thu know love yet spoil love thu
To lose dream O silli beat wing
great dream splendid miracul
O lord O lord merci merci upon us

she turn mind upon holi one
whose love lost love heaven tenfold
she thought luci bless nun
who sent blue eye plate gold
To woo daili love
mine eye mine eye here go peac
but ever love came midnight grove
young love wild eye watch afar
and call call call morn star

Ah poor francesca t thou
that stoni steep heaven climb
take thou thi heaven thi paolo
sweet saint sin saint deathless rhyme
song shall defend thee bar time
dant shall set thi fair young glow face
On dark background theme sublim
and thou He superb disgrac
still golden wind passion shall embrac



So love twain whither pass
Ah dark must alway follow day
that love last kiss sure kiss last
howe wildli poor lip may pray
merci god way
and pen O must thou end write
the hour lanciotto found lay
fold togeth weari delight
within sumptuou petal rose night

yea lanciotto found mani hour
ere dear joy run doom date
had silken nook blossom bower
all unsuspect bless appl ate
who must grind core predestin
kiss kiss poor lose lover deni
one littl tremor bliss fate
cometh upon dark nigh
where unkiss unkiss learn length lie

bent journey state concern
they deem inde rode thereon
but question paolo what return
nay love inde secur gone
As thou art sure belov one
He went ere sundown moon
A fear love heart yet knew none
how could fright littl velvet ear
with last night dream ghostli fear

So yield eager breast
and half forgot could quit forget
No sweetest kiss could put fear rest
and haggard vision chill yet
their warder moon nameless troubl set
there seem traitor echo place
A moan wind moan lover met
and head deep sunk embrac
He saw death window yellow face

had dream caught old lanciotto rein
bent weari huddl steed
In darkl hast along blindfold lane
make clatter halt speed
fool fool cri O dotard fool inde
So ho wanton old man ride
and night flash pictur deed
come dug charger pant side
and homeward dark tore roar tide

As great lord acr thief
steal park flower never see
call lili fair beyond belief
prison wretch fine free
such jealou mad lanciotto seiz
all instant francesca dear
He claim wife never care pleas
all instant seem castl near
and poor lover sleep forgot last fear

hi hors left steam journey end
Up palac stair spring tread
He strode silenc met like friend
fain dissuad deed dread
make breez burn head
lay larg hand comfort soul
within ash cheek burn red
A longshut rose youth goal
Of death sped love tryst stole

He caught sound rose breath
He caught anoth breath deeper lung
roseleav oakleav wind death
He drew asid arra clung
In dim light love young
they lay sin cradl
twin babe one bosom nestl hung
even lanciotto paus ah spare
who could quit forgiv wrong fair

the grave old clock tick somewher gloom
A dozen wait second rose fell
ere pale dagger flicker room
then quench corpselight bosom swell
thu dear mate evermor hell
their blood ran warm sigh
for mad smiter work well
just drew togeth softli die
fell still strang move side side

yea move though two hour watch twain
and heard blood drip drip upon floor
twice stern voic spake
and littl tenderli
thu dear hell mate evermor
and curiou finger day
unravel dark morn wore
and young light play round lay
the soul mani leagu upon hellward way

Of whisper skeleton thing
and heart laugheth low fire

A lusti youth unspil

nay seek answer comfort ye

and dear love comfort
He hath thi leas

To make heart glow brighter lie

Or keep near book

parabl




dear love ask true
If women move
the heart beat
with puls love

out chilli dew one morn
pluck wild sweet rose
A littl silver bud newborn
and long unclos

took love newborn thing
knew heart warm
O littl silver rose come
and shelter storm

and soon bodi press
felt petal part
and look within breast
saw golden heart

O golden heart
your eye may never see
To other alway shut
It open

but see pass
the honeysuckl
and leav lili grass
although fair

whi strang orchid halfaccurst
circ flower grow
can tempt see heart
silver gold rose




deep hidden lane
My littl love
when lo stood kiss
A flower sky

frail tear beauti hung
O spare littl hand
but innoc like ala
desir may withstand

and clamber bank
and threw blossom
but sadder sake
As walk back town


A lovelett

darl littl woman littl line
just littl silver word
for dear gold thine
onli whisper often heard

onli whisper hidden shell
hold littl breath mighti sea
but think littl depth swell
and think littl littl note

darl love thee live
there whisper steal shell
but ocean O deep boundless
and littl wave whisper well


IN the night

kiss dear love
but none hear
onli dark round bed
and hollow silenc thi face fled
though dream come near

slept came back
burn within hollow arch night
like fair flame sacrifici light
and soul sprang mix thee
kiss love
Ah love thi face fair
So cri still thou wert


the constant lover

see fair women day
they pass pass go
almost dream shade
within shadowshow

Of student mirth full half hour

As soon mad piano testifi
while kitchen dinner toward

and laugh john ran stair
and voic call aloud boil pan

so soon reflect the water life
close oer sunken head reflect i

To poor dead

and stretch linger feet littl way

To win time one last haltingplac
which life valley would choos
and choos willing would lose

Or would still youngl lover kiss

and ocean grow placid cup
spring young morn summer strong noon
have dream done die autumn sake
autumn find loss dear

autumn faith widow year

autumn poet full song

hath lost earli magic tongu
and hath passion fail blood
hear ye sound sob air
T low bend secret lane
late bloom second childhood hair
He tri old magic like dotard mage
tri spell spell weep tri
yet daisi hear everywher
the hedgerow rattl like empti cage

He hath pleasur silken sky
nor delic ardour yellow land
yea dead gold woodland lie
and throat music fill sand
neither across stubbl field
may stack garner comfort bring
who loveth jasmin hath made
the littl tender rhyme yet sing
than yesterday pompou yield
Or shaken laurel head


A frost fanci

the world wide around yon court
where dirti littl children play
anoth world street street

and round town endless mile
A great strang land green spread
O wide world O wearywid
but wider overhead

for could mount yon glitter stair
and topmost turret stand
still endless shine court squar
and lane lamp everi hand

and might tread starri street
To long perspect bend
O would cast die
street upon street world without end

their cheek still burn close nestl yet
ere faint breath falter goodnight

He learn great metr thunder hum

So go go back thestyli

Go back thestyli roam
In melancholi meadow mad sing
