new battl news battl

new battl who hath brought

warder warder open quickli
man time wait
and heavi gate open
then murmur long loud
and cri fear wonder

and cheek pale wan
spearless hang bloodi banner
In weak droop hand

tell us oh tell us true
where went battl
randolph murray sworn
where brother children
have met english foe
whi art thou alon unfollow
Is weal woe
like corps grisli warrior
look helm steel
but word speak answer
onli arm heel
chide weari steed onward
Up citi street ride
father sister mother children
shriek pray side
By god made thee randolph
tell us mischanc hath come
then lift riven banner
and asker voic dumb




the elder citi
have met within hall
the men good king jame charg
To watch tower wall
your hand weak age said
your heart stout true
So bide ye maiden town
while other fight
My trumpet bordersid
shall send blast clear
that wait within gate
that stir sound may hear
Or heaven
that back never come
and instead scottish shout
Ye hear english drum
then let warn bell ring
then gird fray
then man wall like burgher stout
and fight fight may
T better fieri flame
the roof thunder
than foot foreign foe
should trampl town




then came randolph murray
hi step slow weak
and dof dint helm
the tear ran cheek
they fell upon corslet
and mail hand
As gaze around wist
lean sore brand
and none beheld
but straight smote fear
for bolder sterner man
had never couch spear
they knew sad messeng
some ghastli news must bring
and father
and son king




and rose provost
A brave old man
Of ancient name knightli fame
and chivalr degre
He rule citi like lord
who brook equal
and ever townsmen right
stood gainst princ peer
and seen scottish host
march boroughmuir
with musicstorm clamor shout
and din thunder
when youth victori sure
but yet dearer thought
for father pride
He saw last remain son
Go forth randolph side
with casqu head spur heel
all keen dare
and proudli gallant boy
dunedin banner bear
Oh woeful old man look
and spake right heavili
now randolph tell thi tide
howev sharp
woe written thi visag
death look thi face
speak though overthrow
It disgrac




right bitter agoni
that wrung soldier proud
thrice strive answer
and thrice groan aloud
then gave riven banner
To old man shake hand
say that bring ye
from bravest land
Ay ye may look upon
It guard well long
By brother children
By valiant strong
one one fell around
As archer laid low
grimli die still unconqu
with face foe
Ay ye well may look upon

els sure brought
from field dark despair
never yet royal banner
steep costli dye
It hath lain upon bosom
where shroud shall lie

IX

but within council chamber
all silent grave
whilst tempest sorrow
shook bosom brave
well inde might shaken
with weight blow
He gone princ idol
whom love worship
like knell death judgment
rung heaven angel hand
fell word desol
On elder land
hoari head bow trembl
wither hand clasp wrung
god left old feebl
He taen away young




then provost upros
and lip ashen white
but flush brow
and eye full light
thou hast spoken randolph murray
like soldier stout true
thou hast done deed dare
had peril
for thou hast shame face us
nor speak thi ghastli tale
stand thou knight captain
here aliv within thi mail
now god shall judg
hold braver done
than hadst thou tarri thi place
and die son
thou needst tell dead
god help us day
but speak fought citizen
within furiou fray
for might mari
T someth still tell
that scottish foot went backward
when royal lion fell


XI

No one fail He keep
royal state semblanc still
knight nobl lie around
cold flodden fatal hill
Of brave gallantheart
whom ye sent prayer away
not singl man depart
from monarch yesterday
had seen O master
when night began fall
and english spearmen gather
round grim ghastli wall
As wolv winter circl
round leaguer heath
So greedi foe glare upward
pant still blood death
but rampart rose
which boldest dare scale
everi stone scottish bodi
everi step corps mail
and behind lay monarch
clench still shiver sword
By side montros athol
At feet southern lord
all thick lay togeth
when star lit sky
that knew stricken
Or yet remain die
few surrey halt
and weari host withdrew
none die men around
when english trumpet blew
then stoop took banner
As ye see breast
and close hero eyelid
and left rest
In mountain growl thunder
As leap woeful wall
and heavi cloud settl
over flodden like pall


xii

So end and other
care answer
sit silent dumb sorrow
sit anguishstruck like men
who seen roar torrent
sweep happi home away
and yet linger margin
stare idli spray
but without madden tumult
wax ever
and crowd wail women
gather round council door
everi duski spire ring
with dull hollow knell
and miserer sing
To toll bell
through street burgher hurri
spread terror go
and rampart throng watcher
for come foe
from mountaintop pillar
stream torpid air
bear token border
that english host
all without flight terror
all within woe fear
god protect thee maiden citi
for thi latest hour near


xiii

No yet thou high dunedin
shalt thou totter thi fall
though thi bravest thi strongest
are man wall
No yet ancient spirit
Of father hath gone
take thee buckler
better far steel stone
Oh rememb perish
for thi birthright time
when scot treason
and side wallac crime
have voic among us
whilst hallow dust
hear ye summon sound
from buri warrior bier
Up say keep freedom
which long ago
Up keep grave unsulli
from insult foe
Up ye save
come us blood fire
midst crash fall turret
let last scot expir


xiv

still bell toll fierc
and cri come louder
mother wail children
sister slaughter kin
all terror disord
till provost rise
calm though tast
Of fell bitter cup
all state sorrow
rose old undaunt chief
that deem see
hi common grief
rous ye sir said may
longer mourn done
If king taken us
We left guard son
We sworn keep citi
from foe whate
and oath taken
never shall broke
death nearer us brethren
than seem die
fight yesterday flodden
By lord master side
let us meet patienc
not terror fear
though heart bleed yonder
let soul steadfast
Up rous ye time fleet
and yet much
Up hast ye citi
stir burgher stout true
gather scatter peopl
fling banner
randolph murray thou bear
As erst born
never scottish heart leav
when see monarch gore


XV

let ceas dismal knell
It time enough ring
when fortressstrength scotland
stoop ruin like king
let bell kept warn
not terror alarm
when next heard thunder
let man stripl arm
bid women leav wail
Do think woeful strain
from bloodi heap flodden
can redeem dearest slain
bid ceas rather hasten
To church everi one
there pray mari mother
and anoint son
that thunderbolt us
may fall ruin yet
that fire blood rapin
scotland glori may set
let pray never women
stood need prayer
england yeomen shall find
cling altar
No doom perish
man maiden let us fall
and common gulf ruin
open wide whelm us
never shall ruthless spoiler
lay hot insult hand
On sister hero
whilst bear torch brand
Up rous ye brother
but next ye hear bell
sound forth sullen summon
that may funer knell
onc let us meet togeth
onc see face
then like men need trembl
Go appoint place
god father fail us
In last tremend hour
If bulwark crumbl
HE strength tower
though rampart rock beneath us
and wall go crash
though roar conflagr
bellow oer sink town
there yet one place shelter
where foeman come
where summon never sound
Of trumpet drum
there ll meet children
who flodden trampl sod
for king countri
render soul god
there shall find rest refug
with dear depart brave
and ash citi
Be univers grave

the execut OF montros




come hither evan cameron
come stand besid knee
hear river roar
toward wintri sea
there shout mountain side
there war within blast
old face look upon
old form go troop past
hear pibroch wail
amidst din fight
and dim spirit wake
upon verg night




T led highland host
through wild lochab snow
what time plaid clan came
To battl montros
ve told thee southron fell
beneath broad claymor
and smote campbel clan
By inverlochi shore
ve told thee swept dunde
and tame lindsay pride
but never told thee yet
how great marqui die




A traitor sold foe
O deed deathless shame
charg thee boy eer thou meet
with one assynt name
Be upon mountain side
Or yet within glen
stand martial gear alon
Or back arm men
face thou wouldst face man
who wrong thi sire renown
rememb blood thou art
and strike caitiff




they brought waterg
hard bound hempen span
As though held lion
and fenceless man
they set high upon cart
the hangman rode
they drew hand behind back
and bare nobl brow
then hound slip leash
they cheer common throng
and blew note yell shout
and bade pass along




It would made brave man heart
grow sad sick day
To watch keen malign eye
bent array
there stood whig westcountri lord
In balconi bow
there sat gaunt wither dame
and daughter arow
and everi open window
wa full full might
with blackrob coven carl
that goodli sport see




but came though pale wan
He look great high
So nobl manli front
So calm steadfast eye
the rabbl rout forebor shout
and man held breath
for well knew hero soul
wa face face death
and mourn shudder
through peopl crept
and came scoff
now turn d asid wept




but onward alway onward
In silenc gloom
the dreari pageant labour
till reach d hous doom
then first woman voic heard
In jeer laughter loud
and angri cri hiss aros
from heart toss crowd
then graem look upward
He met ugli smile
Of sold king gold
the masterfiend argyl




the marqui gaze moment
and noth say
but cheek argyl grew ghastli pale
and turn eye away
the paint harlot side
she shook everi limb
for roar like thunder swept street
and hand clench
and saxon soldier cri aloud
back coward thi place
for seven long year thou hast dare
To look face


IX

had sword hand
and fifti cameron
that day high dunedin street
had peal slogan cri
not troop trampl hors
nor might mail men
not rebel south
had born us backward
onc foot highland heath
had trod free air
Or bore name
been laid around




It might they place next
within solemn hall
where scottish king throne
amidst nobl
but dust vulgar feet
On pollut floor
and perjur traitor fill place
where good men sate
with savag glee came warristoun
To read murder doom
and upros great montros
In middl room


XI

now faith belt knight
and name bear
and bright saint andrew cross
that wave us
yea greater mightier oath
and oh
By dark stream royal blood
that lie twixt
sought battlefield
A wreath renown
nor dare hope die day
To win martyr crown


xii

there chamber far away
where sleep good brave
but better place ye name
than father grave
for truth right gainst treason might
thi hand hath alway striven
and ye rais wit still
In eye earth heaven
then nail head yonder tower
give everi town limb
and god made shall gather
go him


xiii

the morn dawn full darkli
the rain came flash
and jag streak levinbolt
lit gloomi town
the heaven thunder wrath
the fatal hour come
yet ever sound sullenli
the trumpet drum
there mad earth
and anger sky
and young old rich poor
came forth see die


xiv

Ah god ghastli gibbet
how dismal t see
the great tall spectral skeleton
the ladder tree
hark hark clash arm
the bell begin toll
He come come
god merci soul
one last long peal thunder
the cloud clear away
and gloriou sun look
amidst dazzl day


XV

He come come
like bridegroom room
came hero prison
To scaffold doom
there glori forehead
there lustr eye
and never walk battl
more proudli die
there colour visag
though cheek wan
and marvel saw pass
that great goodli man


xvi

He mount scaffold
and turn crowd
but dare trust peopl
So might speak aloud
but look upon heaven
and clear blue
and liquid ether
the eye god shone
yet black murki battlement
lay rest hill
As though thunder slept within
all els calm still


xvii

the grim geneva minist
with anxiou scowl drew near
As seen raven flock
around die deer
He would deign word sign
but alon bent knee
and veil face christ dear grace
beneath gallowstre
then radiant seren rose
and cast cloak away
for taen latest look
Of earth sun day


xviii

A beam light fell oer
like glori round shriven
and climb lofti ladder
As path heaven
then came flash cloud
and stun thunder roll
and man dare look aloft
for fear everi soul
there anoth heavi sound
A hush groan
and dark swept across sky
the work death done

where long billow swept away
the foam behind track

and aye sail d aye sail d
across weari sea
until one morn coast spain

We heard clash atab

whi sound yon eastern music
So wantonli long
and whose crowd arm men
that round yon standard throng

the moor come africa
To spoil wast slay
and king alonzo castil
must fight today

now shame cri good lord jame

We ll let scottish lion loos

Or yet golden fee
Or bring ye franc lili
Or flower burgundi

but sake bless lord
who die upon tree

We bring great king robert heart
across welter wave
To lay holi soil

where danger bar way
and therefor lord king
To ride thee day

the king bent state head
and tear eyn
god bless thee nobl knight
for brave thought thine

know thi name full well lord jame
and honour d may
that fought besid bruce
should fight day

take thou lead van
and charg moor amain
there lanc thine
In host spain

the dougla turn toward us
O glanc high
there one men
but bold

there one knight
but bear true spear
then onward scottish gentlemen
and think king robert

the trumpet blew crossbolt flew
the arrow flash like flame
As spur side spear rest
against foe came

and mani beard saracen
went hors man
for rank rode like corn
So furious ran

but behind path close
though fain let us
for forti thousand men
and wondrou

We might see lanc length
So dens array
but long fell sweep scottish blade
still held hard bay

make make lord dougla cri
make brethren dear
sir william saint clair
We may leav

but thicker thicker grew swarm
and sharper shot rain
and hors rear amid press
but would charg

now jesu help thee said lord jame
thou kind true St clair
An may bring thee
ll die besid thee

then stirrup stood
So lionlik bold
and held preciou heart aloft
all case gold

He flung far ahead
and never spake
but pass thee first thou dauntless heart
As thou wert wont yore

the roar fight rose fiercer yet
and heavier still stour
till spear spain came shiver
and swept away moor

now prais god day
they fli oer flood fell
whi dost thou draw rein hard
good knight fought well

Oh ride ye lord king said
and leav dead
for must keep dreariest watch
that ever shall dree

there lie besid master heart
the dougla stark grim
and woe
not side side

the world grow cold arm old
and thin lyart hair
and love best earth

O bothwel bank bloom bright
beneath sun may
the heaviest cloud ever blew
Is bound day

and scotland thou mayst veil thi head
In sorrow pain

We ll bear back unto ship
We ll bear oer sea
and lay hallow earth
within countri

and thou strong heart lord king
for tell thee sure
the sod drank dougla blood
shall never bear moor

the king light hors
He flung brand away
and took dougla hand
So state lay

god give thee rest thou valiant soul
that fought well spain
d rather half land gone
So thou wert

We bore good lord jame away
and priceless heart bore
and heavili steer d ship
toward scottish shore

No welcom greet return
nor clang martial tread
but dumb hush death
befor mighti dead

We laid chief dougla kirk
the heart fair melros
and woeful men day
god grant soul repos

the burial march OF dunde


sound fife cri slogan
let pibroch shake air
with wild triumphal music
worthi freight bear
let ancient hill scotland
hear battlesong
swell within glen valley
As clansmen march along
never field combat
never deadli fray
wa nobler trophi carri
than bring us today
never sinc valiant dougla
On dauntless bosom bore
good king robert heart priceless
To dear redeem shore
Lo bring us hero
Lo bring conquer graem
crown best beseem victor
from altar fame
fresh bleed battl
whenc spirit took flight
midst crash charg squadron
and thunder fight
strike say note triumph
As march oer moor lea
Is ventur
To bewail dead dunde
let widow traitor
weep eye dim
wail ye may full well scotland
let none dare mourn
see gloriou bodi
lie royal banner fold
see valiant blood mingl
with crimson gold
see calm look state
like warrior shield
wait till flush morn
break along battlefield
see Oh never comrad
shall see falcon eye
redden inward lightn
As hour fight drew nigh
never shall hear voic
clearer trumpet call
bade us strike king countri
bade us win field fall
On height killiecranki
yestermorn armi lay
slowli rose mist column
from river broken way
hoars roar swollen torrent
and pass wrap gloom
when clansmen rose togeth
from lair amidst broom
then belt tartan
and bonnet drew
and felt broadsword edg
and prove true
and pray prayer soldier
and cri gatheringcri
and clasp hand kinsmen
and swore die
then leader rode us
On warhors black night
well cameronian rebel
knew charger fight
and cri exult
from beard warrior rose
for love hous clavers
and thought good montros
but rais hand silenc
soldier sworn vow
ere eveningstar shall glisten
On schehallion lofti brow
either shall rest triumph
Or anoth graem
shall die battlehar
for countri king jame
think upon royal martyr
think race endur
think butcher murder d
On field magu muir
By sacr blood charg ye
By ruin d hearth shrine
By blight hope scotland
By injuri mine
strike day anvil
lay beneath blow
Be coven traitor
Or brood fals argyl
strike drive trembl rebel
backward oer stormi forth
let tell pale convent
how fare within north
let tell highland honour
Is bought sold
that scorn princ anger
As loath foreign gold
strike fight
If ye look vain
where dead lie thickest
search dunde

loudli hill reecho
with answer call
but deeper echo sound
In bosom us
for land wide breadalban
not man heard speak
would day left battl
burn eye flush cheek
told clansmen fierc emot
and harder drew breath
for soul strong within
stronger grasp death
soon heard challengetrumpet
sound pass
and distant tramp hors
and voic foe
down crouch amid bracken
till lowland rank drew near
pant like hound summer
when scent state deer
from dark defil emerg
next saw squadron come
lesli foot leven trooper
march tuck drum
through scatter wood birch
oer broken ground heath
wound long battalion slowli
till gain field beneath
then bound covert

when saw rug mountain

when flood black yule

In garri deepest pool

On field killiecranki
when stubborn fight done

and eveningstar shine
On schehallion distant head
when wipe bloodi broadsword
and return count dead
there found gash gori

As told us seek
In thickest slain
and smile visag
for within die ear

and clansmen clamor cheer
So amidst battl thunder

In glori manhood

open wide vault athol
where bone hero rest
open wide hallow portal
To receiv anoth guest

On mountain muir

for race slew thi sire
till deep dark glenlyon

than midnight eyri
scare eagl glenco
louder scream mingl
with howl blast
when murder steel clash
and fire rise fast
when thi nobl father bound
To rescu men
and slogan kindr

stumbl midnight snow
with father hous blaze
and dearest dead
Oh horror tempest
As flash drift blown

and roof went thunder
Oh prayer prayer curs

the rhine run deep red

now one host

for alon river sweep
might make brave man quail

their shot come fast hail
god help us middl isl
We may hope win
now host

the ford deep bank steep
the islandshor lie wide
nor man hors could stem forc
Or reach side
see amidst willow bough
the serri bayonet gleam
they ve flung bridg ve isl
the foe cross stream
their volley flash sharp strong
By saint trow
there never yet soldier born
could forc passag




So spoke bold french maresch
with led van
whilst rough red view
the turbid river ran
nor bridg boat cross
the wild swollen rhine
and thunder bank
far stretch german line
hard stood swarthi man
wa lean sword
and sadden smile lit face
As heard captain word
ve seen wilder stream ere
than rush
ve stem heavier torrent yet
and never thought dare
If german steel sharp keen
Is strong true
there may danger deed
but honour




the old lord saddl turn
and hastili said
hath bold dugueselin fieri heart

thou art leader scot
now well sure know
that gentl blood danger hour

Do mortal may
If honour boon ye seek
It may day

If follow thee




right gladsom look captain
and noth say

Oh ween

No one compani

not one whose father stood
In scotland field fame
all march great dunde
To fought fell
and deadli battlestrif
had veng leader well
and bent knee earth
when everi eye dim
As oer hero buri corps
they sang funer hymn
and trod pass
and stoop either side
To pluck heather spot
where drop die
and bound next heart
and taen last farewel
Of scottish earth scottish sky
where scotland glori fell
then went forth foreign land
like bent broken men
who leav dearest hope behind
and may turn




the stream said broad deep
and stubborn foe
yon islandstrength guard well
say brother ye go
from home kin mani year
our step wander wide
and never may bone laid
our father grave besid
No sister lament
No wive wail fall
the traitor spoiler hand
have reft hearth
but heart arm
As strong dare
As ancient banner flew
within northern air
come brother let name spell
shall rous soul
and send old blood bound free
through puls heart vein
call back day bygon year
Be young strong
think yonder stream stark red
Is one ve cross
rise hill glen rise crag wood
rise either hand
again upon garri bank
On scottish soil stand
again see tartan wave
again trumpet ring
again hear leader call
upon king
stay behind gloriou day
for roar flood linn

No stay paus with one accord
they grasp other hand
and plung angri flood
that bold dauntless band
high flew spray head
yet onward still bore
midst cheer shout answer yell
and shot cannon roar
now holi cross swear
sinc earth sea began
wa never dare deed
essay mortal man




thick blew smoke across stream
and faster flash flame
the water plash hiss jet
As ball bullet came
yet onward push cavali
all stern undismay
with thousand arm foe
and none behind aid
onc near middl stream
So strong torrent swept
that scarc long live wall
their danger foot kept
then rose warn cri behind
A joyou shout
the current strong way long
they ll never reach shore

Of rough rapid rhine

In vain leader forward press

O lone island rhine
where seed never sown
what harvest lay upon thi sand
By strong reaper thrown
what saw winter moon night
As struggl rain

On marsh stream plain
A dreari spot corps strewn
and bayonet glisten round
A broken bridg strand boat
A bare batter mound
and one huge watchfir kindl pile
that sent quiver glare
To tell leader host

ON the anniversari OF culloden


take away star garter

neither king princ shall tempt
from lone room night
fit throneless exil
Is atmospher pall
and gusti wind shiver
neath tapestri wall
when taper faintli dwindl
like puls within vein
that gay merri measur
neer may hope bound
let shadow gather round
while sit silenc
brokenheart orphan
watch father bier
let hold still communion
far everi earthli sound
day penanc day passion
ever year come round
fatal day whereon latest
die cast mine
cruel day quell fortun
Of hapless stuart line
phantomlik mirror
rise griesli scene death
there wild
stretch bare culloden heath
there broken clan scatter
gaunt wolv famineey
hunger gnaw vital
hope abandon pride
pride suprem devot
which southron never knew
and hatr deepli rankl
gainst hanoverian crew
Oh god remnant
these wreck array
that around royal standard
gather gloriou day
when deep glenfinnan valley
thousand bend knee
saw state ensign
wave northern breez
when nobl tullibardin
stood beneath welter fold
with ruddi lion ramp
In field tressur gold
when mighti heart scotland
all big slumber
burst wrath exult
like huge volcano roar
there stand batter column
underneath murki sky
In hush desper
not conquer die
hark bagpip fit wail
not pibroch loud shrill
that hope bloodi banquet
lure raven hill
but dirg low solemn
fit ear die men
marshal latest battl
never fight
mad mad whi shrink
were less inur war
when reaper swept harvest
from field red dunbar
bring hors blow trumpet
call rider fitzjam
let lord lewi head column
valiant chief mighti name
trusti keppoch stout glengarri
gallant gordon wise locheil
bid clansmen hold togeth
fast fell firm steel
elcho never look gloomi
what avail sadden brow
heart man heart need sore
never half much
had thousand trooper
had thousand
nobl perth hear come
hark english cannon roar
god aw sound volley
bellow mist rain
wa highland slogan
let hear shout
Oh prophet eye wit
how desper battl goe
cumberland would fear thee
could cameron see foe
sound say charg ventur
T nake steel fear
better perish mele
than shot like driven deer
hold mist begin scatter
there front t rent asund
and cloudi bastion crumbl
underneath deafen thunder
there see scarlet gleam
now macdonald never
woe clan broken
father thou art lost ever
chief vassal lord yeoman
there lie heap togeth
smitten deadli volley
roll blood upon heather
and hanoverian horsemen
fierc ride fro
deal murder stroke random
Ah god
will bale vision never
vanish ach sight
must scene sound terror
haunt still day night
yea earth hath oblivion
for noblest chanc gave
none save latest refug
seek grave
love may die hatr slumber
and memori decay
As water garden reck
Of drought yesterday
but dream power broken
what shall give repos
what shall charm serpentfuri
coil around madden brain
what kind draught natur offer
strong enough lull sting
better born peasant
than live exil king
Oh year bitter anguish
what life
with heart palsi
As wast crippl knee
suppliantlik alm depend
On fals foreign court
jostl flout nobl
half piti half sport
forc hold place pageant
like royal prize war
walk deject featur

wors far fanci freedom
than captiv clank chain
could chang gild bondag
even duski tower
whenc king jame beheld ladi
sit castl bower
bird around sweetli sing
flutter kindl spray
and come garden glow
In light rosi may
love descend window
love remov bolt bar
love warder lover
from dawn evenstar
wherefor love didst thou betray
where tender glanc
where mean look lavish
By darkey maid franc
where word hope whisper
when around neck threw
that scarf broider tissu
bade wear true
bade send token
when banner wave
On castl keep london
where father wave
and went conquer
but brought back
brought back storm battl
brought back without stain
and knelt
and laid feet
say wilt thou princess
there least defeat
scorn look upon
with measur eye cold
scorn view token
though finger wrought gold
and answer faintli flush
hast thou kept long
worthi matter minstrel
To told knightli song
worthi bold provenc
pace peac plain
sing ladi favour
boast silken chain
yet scarc worthi warrior
sent wrestl crown
Is thou hast brought
from thi field high renown
Is trophi carri
from land thou hast
It broider princess
canst thou give queen
woman love writ water
woman faith trace sand
backward backward let wander
To nobl northern land
let feel breez blow
fresh along mountainsid
let see purpl heather
let hear thunder tide
Be hoars corrievreckan
spout storm high
give one hour scotland
let see ere die
Oh heart sick heavi
southern gale
though glen white winter
place set free
give back trusti comrad
give back highland maid
nowher beat heart kindli
As beneath tartan plaid
flora thou wert besid
In wild far kintail
when cavern gave us shelter
from blind sleet hail
when lurk within thicket
and beneath wane moon
saw sentri bayonet glimmer
heard chant listless tune
when howl storm oertook us
drift island lee
and crazi bark whirl
like nutshel sea
when night dark dreari
and amidst fern lay
faint foodless sore travel
wait streak day
when thou wert angel
watch exhaust sleep
never didst thou hear murmur
couldst thou see weep
bitter tear sob anguish
unavail though
Oh brave brave nobl
that die vain

should make heart beat high
bring crimson forehead
and lustr eye
It song olden time
Of day long sinc gone
and baron stout bold
As eer wore sword thigh
like brave old scottish cavali
all olden time




He kept castl north
hard thunder spey
and thousand vassal dwelt around
all kindr
and man clan
had ever ceas pray
for royal race love well
though exil far away
from steadfast scottish cavali
all olden time




hi father drew righteou sword
for scotland claim
among loyal gentlemen
and chief ancient name
who swore fight fall beneath
the standard king jame
and die killiecranki pass
with glori graem
like true old scottish cavali
all olden time




He never own foreign rule
No master obey
but kept clan peac home
from foray raid
and ask oath
He touch glitter blade
and point bonnet blue
that bore white cockad
like leal old scottish cavali
all olden time




At length news ran land
the princ come
that night fieri cross sped
oer mountain glen
and old baron rose might
like lion den
and rode away across hill
To charli men
with valiant scottish cavali
all olden time




He first bent knee
when standard wave abroad
He first charg foe
On preston bloodi sod
and ever van fight
the foremost still trod
until bleak culloden heath
He gave soul god
like good old scottish cavali
all olden time




Oh never shall know
A heart stout true
the olden time pass away
and weari new
the fair white rose fade
from garden grew
and fond tear save heaven
the gloriou bed bedew
Of last old scottish cavali
all olden time




miscellan poem




blind old milton


place daughter sun
may shine upon old timeworn head
for last time perchanc My race run
and soon amidst eversil dead
must repos may half forgot
ye broke hard bitter bread
for mani year trembl
To buckl armour fight
and set tyrant lot
and never bow might
nor knelt bear within
My heart sternest conscious right
and perpetu hate gild sin
which made though stain
Of poverti yet win
more honour blind train
who hug will servitud bow
unto weakest profan
therefor unencumb soul go
befor footstool maker
hope stand undebas
child sun abroad feel hair
born waft gentl wind
feel odour perfum air
and hear rustl leav behind
within heart pictur
almost forget blind
and old hate fellowmen
yet would fain behold grace
Of natur ere die gaze
upon live rejoic face
fain would see thi counten child
My comfort feel thi dear embrac
hear thi voic music mild
the patient sole interpret
So mani year sad beguil
for hath made small scanti room
peopl glow vision past
but calmli bend doom
and wait hour approach fast
when tripl light shall stream upon mine eye
and heaven open last
To dare foretel mysteri
vision drear eclips
Of outward conscious clomb sky
strive utter earthli lip
what divin soul half divin
even saint apocalyps
who saw inmost glori enshrin
sat He fashion glori thi hath driven
all outward strife tumult mind
and humbl forgiven
My bitter enemi seek
To find straight narrow path heaven

yet weak oh entir weak
for one may love suffer
sometim unbidden tear wet cheek
and heart bound keenli yore
respons voic hush rest
which made beauti italian shore
In pomp summer vineyard drest
An eden paradis
Do sweet breez balmi west
still murmur thi grove parthenop
In search odour orang bower
still thi slope verdur bee
cull rare honey virgin flower
and philomel plaintiv chaunt prolong
neath sky calm seren
make summer one perpetu song
art thou manhood pride
walk joy thi grassi mead among
with fair youth vision side
In whose bright eye look vain
O ador angel O bride
despit year woe want pain
My soul yearn back toward thee seem
To wander thee hand hand
By bright margin flow stream
hear thi voic silversweet
than fanci music float dream
possess afar greet
the wave thi garment glade
and light rustl thi fairi feet
what time one half eager half afraid
love burn secret falter tongu
and tremul look broken word betray
the secret heart whenc sprung
Ah earth render thee heaven
gave angel beauti young
spotless pure snow freshli driven
A bright aurora starri sphere
where love even life forgiven
bride immort beauti ever dear
dost thou await thi blest abod
while tithonuslik must linger
and count step along rug road
A phantom totter longmad grave
and eager lay weari load

fanci lord fanci slave
like low murmur indian shell
taen coral bed beneath wave
which unforget ocean swell
retain within mystic urn hum
heard seagrot nereid dwell
old thought still haunt unawar come
between rest make
those age visitor sorrow dumb
Oh yet awhil feebl soul awak
nor wander back sullen step
for neither pleasant pastim canst thou take
In journey endur pain
the phantom past dead thee
So let ever uninvok remain
and thou calm till death shall set thee free
thi flower hope expand long ago
long sinc blossom wither tree
No second spring come make blow
but silent winter grave
they lie blight love buri woe

wast gift natur gave
nor sloth lay circean bower
nor yield will slave
Of lust pride rich power
No heart nobler spirit dwelt
for constant faith manhood dower
man made god imag felt
how accord court shame
until idol like knelt
and renounc great gloriou claim
Of freedom immort heritag
saw bigotri spite aim
smote search eyesight sage
how error stole behind step truth
and cast delus sacr page
So champion even earli youth
wage battl purpos keen
nor fear hand terror tooth
Of serpent jealousi and
with starri galileo cell
that wise magician brow seren
who fathom space seen tell
the wonder planetari sphere
and trace rampart heaven citadel
On cold flagston dungeon drear
and walk hampden vane
name graciou english ear
In day never may return
My voic though loudest hath heard
whenev freedom rais cri pain
and faint effort humbl bard
hath rous thousand lethargi
To speak word thunder what reward
wa mine It matter
Am leaf cast whirl tide
without hope wish except die
but truth assert must still abid
unquench fieri spring
which day night gush mountainsid
perpetu meteor girt lambent wing
which wild tempest toss fro
but conquer forc bring
yet ever felt anoth woe
more keenli untold distress
battl common foe
and broke year bread bitter
who never yet abandon betray
the trust vouchsaf ceas bless
Am left alon wither shade
A weak old man desert kind
whom none comfort age aid

Oh let repin A quiet mind
consciou upright need stay
nor griev leav behind
In rich promis etern day
henceforth world dead gone
it thorn unfelt rose cast away
and old pilgrim weari alon
bow travel master gate
now sit task lifelong labour done
thank rest although come late
after sore journey world sin
In hope prayer wist wait
until door shall ope let

oenon

On holi mount ida
where pine cypress grow
sate young love woman
weep ever weep low
drearili throughout forest
did wind autumn blow
and cloud fli
and scamand roll

faithless pari cruel pari
thu poor desert spake
wherefor thu strang leav
whi thi love bride forsak
whi tender word part
whi kiss farewel take
would could forget thee
would throb heart might break

Is face longer bloom
are eye longer bright
Ah tear made dimmer
and cheek pale white
wept sinc earli morn
weep livelong night
now long sullen dark
As long light

pari canst thou cruel
fair young brave thou art
can thi bosom
lie cold hard heart
children bred togeth
she bore suckl thee
thine old companion
when thou hadst

watch thee thi slumber
when shadow dream
pass across thi smile featur
like rippl stream
and sweetli vision
pictur live grace
that half could read import
By chang thi face

when sang ariadn
sang old mourn tale
how faithless lover theseu
left lament wail
then thine eye would fill glisten
her complaint could soften thee
thou hast wept ariadn
theseu self might weep

thou mayst find anoth maiden
with fairer face mine
with gayer voic sweeter
and spirit liker thine
for eer beauti bound thee
lost broken spell
but thou canst find anoth
that love thee half well

O thou hollow ship bearest
pari oer faithless deep
wouldst thou leav island
where alon water weep
where human foot mould
In wet yellow sand
leav thou hollow vessel
leav lone land

then heart sure soften
when foolish hope decay
and older love rekindl
As new one die away
visionari hill haunt
rise glassi sea
and thought wander homeward
unto ida

O like littl swallow
could reach lone spot
all error would pardon
all weari past forgot
never wander
never depart
for arm would prison
and home would heart

thu lament fair oenon
weep ever weep low
On holi mount ida
where pine cypress grow
In selfsam hour cassandra
shriek propheci woe
and spartan dwell
did faithless pari go




the buri flower


In silenc chamber
when night still deep
and drowsi heav ocean

oft hear angelvoic
that thrill long ago
voic lost companion
ly deep beneath snow

O garden rememb
In gay sunni spring
when laughter made thicket

O whisper never utter

O light life sparkl
In bright bounteou eye
O blush happi beauti

To clear blue heaven

As modest blossom trembl
At woo bee

O t sad lie reckon

By idl thought strife
such time might knit togeth
not broken chord life

O heart truli
kept anoth time tune
heart kindl springtid
look around thee noon

where gave impuls
To thi earliest thought flow
look around ruin garden
all wither drop low

seek birthplac lili
dearer boyish dream
than golden cup eden

she rose fullest beauti

O fling spirit backward

more long ago
saw heavenli shape descend
over ida slope snow

when low solemn music

and throstl song silenc

when immort beauti open
all grace mortal sight
and awe worship blend

As shepherd stood

and watch thee ever fondli
watch thee dearest afar
with mute humbl homag
Of indian star

In morn garb bloom

So mani day follow

ere heart rose bless thee
for yield smile

ere thi word broken
As answer back mine
ere lip power thank thee
for gift vouchsaf thine

then mighti gush passion
through inmost ran
then older life end
and dearer cours began

what world doubt dark

not asleep love art thou
dwell land glori
with saint angel

brighter fairer far live
with trace woe pain
robe everlast beauti
shall see thee

By light never fadeth
underneath etern sky
when dawn resurrect
break oer deathless paradis




the old camp


written IN A roman fortif IN bavaria



there cloud sun
the wind hush still
and silent water run
beneath sombr hill
the sky dark everi place
As earth
methink wore selfsam face
two thousand year ago




No light ancient wall
No light upon mound
the tree thick tall
cast gloom shade around
So silent place cold
So far human ken
It hath look make old
and spectr time




listen half thought hear
the roman trumpet blow
search glint helm spear
amidst forest bough
and armour ring voic swell
hear legion tramp
and mark lone sentinel
who guard lone camp




methink home
No hearth find
for noth save thought rome
Is stir mind
and heard dream
and forgot
are rise though seem
the household spot




and name roman knew
seem known
As roman
A roman born free
and could rise caesar name
As though charm
To draw sharp lightn tame
and brace coward arm




and yet yonder sky blue
and earth sunni gay
If natur wore summer hue
that deck yesterday
the mound trench rampart space
would move noth
than mani sweet sequestr place
that mark




could feel breez bring
rich odour tree
could hear linnet sing
and think theme like
the paint insect pass
In swift motley strife
the lizard grass
would scare back life




then past gloomi
that may never bear
the open smile natur brow
Or meet sunni air
know joy power
howev short last
and joy befit present hour
If sad fit past




danub and the euxin


danub danub wherefor comst thou
red rage cave
wherefor leap thi swollen water
madli broken wave
wherefor thi tide sulli
with hue unknown
wherefor dost thou bring pollut
To old sacr sea

Ha rejoic old father euxin
brim full red

christian river
dull slow mani year
roll torpid water
through silenc morn drear
have felt tread armi
trampl reedi shore
have heard trumpet call
Or cannon gladsom roar
onli listen laughter
from villag town
and churchbel ever jangl
As weari day went
So lay sore ponder
On day long sinc gone
when old primaev forest
echo warman cri
when race thor odin
held battl side
and blood man mingl
warmli chilli tide
father euxin thou remembrest
how brought thee tribut
swollen corps gash gori
head limb slaughter d men
father euxin thou joy
run red
not heathen blood earli
but gallant christian gore
for old time return
and cross broken
and hear tocsin sound
In villag town
and glare burn citi
soon shall light way
Ha heart big jocund
with draught drank today
Ha feel strength awaken
and brethren shout
each leap red joyou
To await sea
rhine elb plung downward
through wild anarch land
everywher christian fall
By brother christian hand
yea old time return
and olden god
take tribut father euxin
To thi water dark drear
therefor come torrent
shake castl crag town
therefor shout thunder
sweep herd herdsman
therefor leap thi bosom
with loud triumphal roar
greet greet father euxin

the scheik OF sinai IN


from the german OF freiligrath



lift without tent say
Me ottoman

from africa thou sayest
and bring us news war
draw without tent quick
As desert well
the fresh purl brook
delight tire gazel
So pant voic
that cometh afar




the scheik lift tent
and thu outspak moor
saw old chief tricolor
On algier topmost tower
upon battlement silk
Of lyon flutter free
each morn marketplac
the musterdrum beat
and warhymn marseil
the squadron pace street
the armament toulon sail
the frank cross sea




toward south column march
beneath cloudless sky
their weapon glitter blaze
Of sun barbari
and dusti desert sand
their hors mane white
the wild maraud tribe dispers
In terror live
they fled unto mountain
with children wive
and urg clumsi dromedari
Up atla height




the moor taen vantageground
the volley thunder fast
the dark defil blaze
like heat ovenblast
the lion hear strang turmoil
and leav mangl prey
No place feed
and thick loud cri
feu allah allah En avant
In mingl discord rise
the frank reach summit
they victori




with bristl steel upon top
the victor take stand
beneath feet town
they see promis land
from tuni even unto fez
from atla sea
the cavali alight gaze
and gaze full well may
where countless minaret stand
So solemnli gray
amidst darkgreen mass
Of flower myrtletre




the almond blossom vale
the alo rock
throw long prickli leav
nor dread tempest shock
A bless land ween
though luckless bey
there lie sea beyond lie franc
her banner air
float proudli triumphantli
A salvo come prepar
and loud long mountain rang
with glad artilleri




T exclaim age scheik

fought beneath pyramid
that day deathless pride
red thi turban moor eve
wa everi creek nile
but tell gripe hand
their sultaun stranger say
hi form face postur man

hi eye wore but moor

their sultaun scheik remain home
within palac wall
He send pasha stead
To brave bolt ball
He An aga burst
for atla hold
yet show thee somewhat
A frankish cavali
told effigi stamp

He gave other

the old man took golden coin

If could sultaun

T his eye t his brow

epitaph OF constantin kanari

In bed die christian

yet t someth ve laid
In land without stain
keep thu god saviour

the refus OF charon


from the romaic

whi look distant mountain
So gloomi drear
are raincloud pass oer
Or tempest near
No shadow temptest
Is wind rain
T charon pass
with gloomi train

the young men march
In strength pride
the tender littl infant
they totter side
the old men walk behind
and earnestli pray
both old young implor
To grant brief delay

O charon halt pray thee
besid littl town
Or near sparkl fountain
where water wimpl
the old drink refresh
the young disc fling
and tender littl children
pluck flower besid spring

stay journey
nor halt town
near sparkl fountain
where water wimpl
the mother come well
would know babe bore
the wive would clasp husband
nor could part
