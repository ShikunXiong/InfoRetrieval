the fall OF erech


O moongod hear cri with thi pure light
Oh take spirit aw night
that hover oer longforgotten year
To sing accadia song weep tear
T thu pray lo spirit rose
On fleeci cloud enwrapt soft repos
and beheld beneath nation glide
In swift success pride
the earth fill citi mankind
and empir fell beneath summer wind
the soil clay walk forth upon plain
In form life everi atom gain
A place man breath anim
and flesh blood bone becom wall
Of palac citi soon fall
To unknown dust beneath ancient wall
all saw guid stroke
Of unseen pinion

then amid smoke
that rose oer burn citi beheld
white kharsakkurra brow aris held
the secret god felt prore
Of khasisadra ark heard roar
Of battl element saw wave
that toss mankind commingl grave
the mighti mountain sentinel

A halo bright divin summit crown
with sunbeam shine earth around
and oer wide expans plain
lay kharsakkalama light aglow
and nestl far away within view
stood erech nipur marad eridu
and babylon towerc old
In splendor shone like burnish gold
and lo grand erech gloriou day
lie feet see wondrou maze
Of vista group cluster column round
within without palac ground
Of outer staircas massiv grand

A thousand carv column reach high
To silver rafter azur sky
and palac templ round rise
with lofti turret glow sky
and massiv wall far spread oer plain
here live move accadia courtli train

and yonder come kisib nobleman

and chariot peopl wise skill
In thing terrestri scienc art
here reign with laden ship everi mart
the dock fill foreign fabric bring
from peopl land mani empir king
have live pass away naught left
In histori song dread time hath cleft
Us far apart king kingdom priest
and bard gone oer sweep mist
Of dark backward spread time
their record swept away everi clime
those alabast stair let us ascend
and lofti portal wend
see richest sumir rug amass subdu
the tile pavement vari hue

Of gold silver crescent bright pair
and goldfring scarlet curtain grace door
and inlaid column reach floor

Of yon grand chamber tread antiqu floor

and harp tinkl cymbal measur drum
while soft echo chamber come

but see sovereign lift jewel hand

and lo two chief warrior array
