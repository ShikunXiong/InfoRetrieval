Y sino ahi esta el doctor jorg bull profesor de teologia

como lo punto que por la mayor part trato en ella son sobr lo
misterio capital de nuestra santa Fe convien saber sobr el
misterio de la trinidad sobr el de la divinidad de cristo en lo
cual su pseudaiglesia anglicana se desvia de la catolica en
verdad que lo manejo con tanto nervio con tanta delicadeza que
lo teologo ortodojo ma escolastizado como si dijeramo
electrizado hacen grand estimacion de dicha obra Y aun en lo
do tratado que escribio acerca de la justif que es punto ma
resvaladizo en lo principio que abrazo se separo de lo
teologo catolico pero en alguna consecuencia que infirio ya dio
