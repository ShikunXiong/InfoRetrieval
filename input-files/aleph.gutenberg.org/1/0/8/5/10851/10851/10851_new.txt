talfourd S vers IN memori OF A child name after charl lamb

from the final memori OF charl lamb

see letter page

our gentl charl pass d away
from earth short bondag free
and left us leaden day
and mistenshroud sea

here restless ocean side
sweet hour hope flown
when first triumph tide
seem d omen

that eager joy seabreez gave
when first rais hair
sunk day retir wave
beyond reach prayer

the sunblink drizzl mist
To flicker hope akin
lone wave feebl fond kiss d
No smile faint win

yet vain radianc weak
the heavenli stranger gleam
not world light speak
but whenc stream

that world patient suffer sought
seren piti eye
As mount spirit caught
the wisdom sky

with boundless love look d abroad
for one bright moment given
shone loveli aw d
and quiver d heaven

A year made slow care toil
ha pace weari round
sinc death enrich d kindr spoil
the snowclad frostribb d ground

then lamb whose endear name
our boy proudli grace
shrank warmth sweeter fame
than mightier bard embrac

still t mourn joy think
our darl might suppli
for year us live link
To name die

and though fanci gleam
On earthli sorrow night
truth nobler torch unveil shore
which lend light

the nursel hand may take
none ever grasp d vain
and smile wellknown sweet wake
without ting pain

though twixt child childlik bard
late seem distinct wide
they may trace heaven regard
how near alli

within infant ampl brow
blyth fanci lay unfurl d
which uncrush d may open
To charm sinless world

though soft spirit eye
might neer lamb S compet
neer sparkl wit wise
Or melt tear sweet

that calm unforgotten look
A kindr love reveal
with never friend forsook
Or hurt thing feel

In thought profound wildest glee
In sorrow dark strang
the soul lamb bright infanc
endur spot chang

from trait love receiv
for comfort nobler scope
while light childlik geniu leav
confirm infant hope

and hope sweet fraught
Be ach heart beguil
To blend one delight thought
the poet child


edward fitzgerald S the meadow IN spring

from hone S year book

see letter page

T sad sight
To see year die
when autumn last wind
set yellow wood sigh
sigh oh sigh

when time cometh
retir
into old room
besid bright fire
Oh pile bright fire

and sit
read old thing
Of knight ladi
while wind sing
Oh drearili sing

never look
nor attend blast
for seen
Is leav fall fast
fall fall

but close hearth
like cricket sit
read summer
and chivalri
gallant chivalri

then old friend
talk youth
how t gladsom often
foolish forsooth
but gladsom gladsom

Or get merri
We sing old rhyme
that made wood ring
In summer time
sweet summer time

then take smoke
silent snug
naught pass us
save brown jug
sometim sometim

and sometim tear
will rise eye
see two old friend
So merrili
So merrili

and ere bed
Go go
down ash
We kneel knee
pray pray

thu live
till break gloom
Of winter bold sun
Is room
shine shine

then cloud part
swallow soar
the spring awak
and meadow green

jump like mad
break old pipe twain
and away meadow
the meadow

dear lamb drink thee thee

what old friend art thou freed
from bondag pen
free care toil inde
free wander amongst men
when howsoe thou wilt

On huge figur page
which sleep unclasp d age
littl know wield
the quill travers white field

come anoth mighti health
thou hast earn d thi sum wealth
countless eas immort leisur

Oh happi thou whose time

Is fill d talk pleasant theme
Or vision quaint come dream
such panther d bacchu rule
when rod school

Or perhap thi wit fine
strayeth elder book
whereon modern solon look
with sever ungift eye
wonder thou seest prize
happi thou whose skill take

thi thirst everi fountain brink
where less wise men would paus shrink
sometim mid state avenu
with cowley thou marvel muse
dost walk gray eton tower
Or pope hampton chesnut bower
Or walton love lea stream
Or dost thou milton dream
Of eden apocalyps
and hear word great lip

speak grove hazel shade

dost wander penshurst lawn
where sidney fame time dawn
and die ere yet hate men

Or dost thou london street

Or take along pathway sweet
