the selfcontempl OF spirit


If ask cosmo came exist shall find ultim
attribut selfcontempl spirit let us start
fact known modern physic scienc all materi thing
includ bodi compos combin differ
chemic element carbon oxygen nitrogen c chemistri
recogn seventi element peculiar
affin advanc physic scienc present day find
compos one ultim substanc

motion within sphere atom thu curious come back
dictum pythagora univers origin number motion
We may therefor say entir solar system togeth everi sort
materi substanc contain made noth one
primari substanc variou degre condens

now next step realiz ether everywher thi
shown undulatori theori light light substanc

ether us now astronomi show us receiv light
heavenli bodi distant though travel incred
speed  mile per second take two thousand year
reach us star quarter
heaven come conclus primari substanc
ether must univers present

thi mean raw materi format solar system
univers distribut throughout space yet though find million
sun stud heaven also find vast interstellar space show
sign cosmic activ then someth work start cosmic
activ certain area pass other raw
materi equal avail what someth At first might
inclin attribut develop cosmic energi ether
particl littl consider show us
mathemat imposs medium equal distribut
throughout space particl equilibrium one
particl possess per se greater power origin motion
consequ initi movement must start someth
though work particl primari
substanc particl It someth
mean speak spirit

then sinc spirit start condens primari substanc
concret aggreg also certain area exclus
other avoid attribut spirit power select
take initi account

here find initial polar univers spirit
univers substanc complementari
relat subsequ evolut proce be complementari mean
suppli want two togeth
thu make complet whole now case spirit
suppli select motion substanc suppli someth
select made motion impart
sine qua non express spirit

then come question how univers substanc get It
made qualiti inertia therefor must
come sourc power project mode
action materi natur now mode action
materi natur thought therefor thought must look
origin substanc thi place us point anteced exist
even primari substanc consequ initi action must
origin mind upon itself word selfcontempl

At primordi stage neither time space recogn
impli measur success interv primari movement
mind upon conscious must present absolut
be extern point exist measur extens
either time space henc must elimin idea time
space concept spirit initial selfcontempl

thi spirit primari contempl simpli be
necessarili make presenc univers etern consequ
paradox may seem independ time space make
present throughout time space It old esoter maxim
point expand infinitud infinitud concentr
point We start spirit contempl simpli be
but realiz must conscious conscious
come recognit relat someth els the
someth els may extern fact mental imag even
latter case conceiv imag must mental stand back
look someth like man run polic

thi may seem like extract paddi philosophi make
clear conscious attain recognit
someth recogn ego word

now one thing may quit sure spirit life must feel
alive then feel aliv must consciou consciou

the next thing sinc begin noth except

plastic medium whose particl perfect equilibrium
exactli descript primari substanc ether We thu

from point onward shall find principl polar univers

therefor basi evolution

thi great fundament truth get right order
age prolif sourc error get
wrong order and wrong order consist make polar
origin point creativ process what misconcept lead
shall see later sinc wide accept variou
