A rough rhyme ON A rough matter

the merri brown hare came leap
over crest hill
where clover corn lay sleep
under moonlight still

leap late earli
till bite tread
the swede wheat barley
lay canker trampl dead

A poacher widow sat sigh
On side white chalk bank
where gloomi firwood
one spot ley throve rank

she watch long tuft clover
where rabbit hare never ran
for black sour haulm cover
the blood murder man

she thought dark plantat
and hare husband blood
and voic indign
rose throne god

long past wail whine
wept much life
ve twenti year pine
As english labour wife

A labour christian england
where cant saviour name
and yet wast men live like vermin
for brace game

there blood new foreign shrub squir
there blood pointer feet
there blood game sell squir
and blood game eat


you villain interpos squir when ever sell head
game


you sold labour man squir
bodi soul shame
To pay seat hous squir
and pay feed game

you made poacher squir
when d give neither work meat
and barleyf hare rob garden
At starv children feet

when pack one reek chamber
man maid mother littl one lay
while rain patter rot brideb
and wall let day

when lay burn fever
On mud cold clay floor
till part us three month squir
At curs workhous door

we quarrel like brute wonder
what selfrespect could keep
wors hous hack pointer
wors fed hog sheep


and yet impud say nt mean grumbl
old man tregarva winc good deal knew come
next look reliev found lancelot omit
stanza shall omit


our daughter baseborn babi
have wander away shame
If miss slept squir
your miss might

can ladi patch heart break
with hand coal rice
Or deal flannel sheet
A littl cost price

you may tire gaol workhous
and take allot school
but ve run debt never
Be repaid us pennyclub rule

In season shame sad
In dark dreari day
when scrofula gout mad
are eat race away

when kennel liveri varlet
you cast daughter bread
and worn liquor harlot
your heir feet lie dead

when youngest mealymouth rector
let soul rot asleep grave
you find god protector
Of freeman fanci slave

she look tuft clover
and wept till heart grew light
and last passion
went wander night

but merri brown hare came leap
over upland still
where clover corn lay sleep
On side white chalk hill
