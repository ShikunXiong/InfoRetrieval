To merit heaven thou heaven resign
afflict even ant though weak small
It breath live life sweet
know temper firm stern bold
didst thou tyrant trembl behold
My sword blooddrop hadst thou sens
To shrink give man like offenc
what could impel thee act base
what earn prove thi disgrac
whi sentenc trod upon

whose power scorn couldst thou presum
would appal thee defi
lion inur blood

and could grind thi limb spread far
As nile dark water rich treasur bear
fear thee fear man god alon
bow almighti throne
inspir him readi number flow

boundless thanksgiv him whose love
support faith realm
the mighti prophet none eer repos
On him exist without hope close

and thou wouldst hurl underneath tread
Of wild eleph till dead
dead insult rous becom
An eleph power seal thi doom
mahmud fear man hath never awe
thi heart least fear thi creator god
full mani warrior illustri worth
full mani humbl imperi birth

O thi father grace kingli throne

A differ fate poet share

but remot thee gloriou line
No high ennobl ancestri thine
from vile stock thi bold career began
A blacksmith thi sire isfahan

clix

aloud say heart glee
love slave world free

can bird sacr garden tell
into net chanc first fell

My place highest heaven angel born
came adam cloister lorn

sweet houri tuba shade fountain brink
fade mind thi street think

know astrolog star birth
lord neath plant bore mother earth

sinc ring ear ve serv love hous wine
grief gratul hour mine

My eyebal man drain heart blood t
In man darl place trust

My love one alifform stamp thought
save letter master taught

let hafiz teardrop
By thi lock dri
for fear perish
In rush tide



clxvi

knowest thou fortun
T beauti sight obtain
T ask lane alm
and royal pomp disdain

sever wish life easi task ever
but lose friend sweeten life tie hard sever

budlik serri heart ll orchard wander
the garment good reput ll tear piec yonder

now doth westwind tell deep secret flower
hear love mysteri sport bulbul bower

kiss thi belov one lip first occas linger
await thou els disgust last bite lip finger

profit companionship twodoor hous forsaken
No pathway thither lead futur time taken

hafiz thought seem
Of shah mansur fleet
O lord remind poor
with favor treat



clxxiii

with heart blood wrote one dear
the earth seem doomstruck thou near

My eye hundr sign absenc show
these tear sign woe

gain boon labor spent
who tri tri end repent

ask fare physician spake
afar health near ach

the eastwind moon remov veil
At morn shone forth sun vapor pale

said they ll mock go round thi lane
By god love escap mocker bane

grant hafiz prayer
one cup life sweet
He seek goblet
with thi grace replet



clxxx

O thou art unlearn still quest love essay
canst thou hast trod path guid other way

while school truth thou stayst master love learn
endeavor though son today father grade earn

slumber food held thee far love exalt good
wouldst thou attain goal love abstain sleep food

If ray love truth thi heart soul clear
By god thi beauti shall outshin sun light sphere

wash dross life thi hand path men old
and win love alchem power transmut thyself gold

On thi frame head foot light god shall shine
If lord glori path head foot thine

An instant plung god sea eer truth forget
that seven sea oerwhelm tide hair thine shall wet

If thi glanc eye repos creator face
thenceforth among men glanc shall doubtless thi place

when thi exist frame upsidedown shall
imagin shall lot thee

hafiz ever thi head
dwell union wish seren
thou must becom threshold dust
Of men whose sight keen
