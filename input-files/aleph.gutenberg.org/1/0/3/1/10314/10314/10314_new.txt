OF

michael angelo buonarroti






on dant alighieri

dal ciel discese


from heaven spirit came robe clay
the realm justic merci trod
then rose live man gaze god
that might make truth clear day
for pure star brighten ray
the undeserv nest born
the whole wide world would prize scorn
none maker due guerdon pay
speak dant whose high work remain
unknown unhonour thankless brood
who men deni wage
were born like linger pain
against exil coupl good
d gladli chang world best heritag





on dant alighieri

quant dirn si de


No tongu tell told
for blind eye splendour shine strong
twere easier blame wrought wrong
than sound least prais mouth gold
He explor place pain bold
then soar god teach soul song
the gate heaven ope bear feet along
against desir countri roll
thankless call pain
the nurs fell mischanc sign take
that ever best deal scorn
among thousand proof let one remain
though neer fortun unjust
hi equal better neer born





to pope juliu ii

Lo thou hast lent thine ear fabl still

the toil less move thi ruth
onc t hope rais thi height
but t balanc power sword
Of justic fals echo need
heaven seem plant virtu despit
here earth reward
To seek fruit tree dri breed





on rome IN the pontif OF juliu ii

qua si fa elmi


here helm sword made chalic
the blood christ sold much quart
hi cross thorn spear shield short
must time ere even patienc ceas
nay let come rais fee
Of foul sacrileg beyond report
for rome still flay sell court
where path close virtu fair increas
now fit time scrape treasur
see work gain gone
who wear robe medusa still
god welcom poverti perchanc pleasur
but better life hope
when bless banner lead nought ill





TO giovanni DA pistoja

on the paint OF the sistin chapel

I ho gia fatto un gozzo

Or land hap

My beard turn heaven nape fall

My buttock like crupper bear weight
My feet unguid wander fro
In front skin grow loos long behind

If pistoja dant curs given

keep dear luigi clear pure
that ancient love life owe
that neither wind storm calm may mar
for wrath pain gratitud obscur
and truest truth love know

TO luigi del riccio
