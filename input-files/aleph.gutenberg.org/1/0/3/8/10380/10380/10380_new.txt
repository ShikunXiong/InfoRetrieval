the burial OF mose


By nebo lone mountain
On side jordan wave
In vale land moab
there lie lone grave
and man know sepulchr
and man saw eer
for angel god upturn sod
and laid dead man

that grandest funer
that ever pass earth
but man heard trampl
Or saw train go forth
noiselessli daylight
come back night done
and crimson streak ocean cheek
grow great sun

noiselessli springtim
her crown verdur weav
and tree hill
open thousand leav
So without sound music
Or voic wept
silent mountain crown
the great process swept

perchanc bald old eagl
On gray bethpeor height
out lone eyri
look wondrou sight
perchanc lion stalk
still shun hallow spot
for beast bird seen heard
that man knoweth

but warrior dieth
hi comrad war
with arm revers muffl drum
follow funer car
they show banner taken
they tell battl
and lead masterless steed
while peal minut gun

amid noblest land
We lay sage rest
and give bard honor place
with costli marbl drest
In great minster transept
where light like glori fall
and organ ring sweet choir sing
along emblazon wall

thi truest warrior
that ever buckl sword
thi gift poet
that ever breath word
and never earth philosoph
trace golden pen
On deathless page truth half sage
As wrote men

and high honor
the hillsid pall
To lie state angel wait
with star taper tall
and dark rockpin like toss plume
over bier wave
and god hand lone land
To lay grave

In strang grave without name
whenc uncoffin clay
shall break O wondrou thought
befor judgment day
and stand glori wrapt around
On hill never trod
and speak strife life
with incarn son god

O lone grave moab land
O dark bethpeor hill
speak curiou heart
and teach still
god hath mysteri grace
way tell
He hide deep like hidden sleep
Of He love well

the destruct OF sennacherib


the assyrian came like wolf fold
and cohort gleam purpl gold
and sheen spear like star sea
when blue wave roll nightli deep galile

like leav forest summer green
that host banner sunset seen
like leav forest autumn hath blown
that host morrow lay wither d strown

for angel death spread wing blast
and breath face foe pass d
and eye sleeper wax d deadli chill
and heart heav forev grew still

and lay steed nostril wide
but roll d breath pride
and foam gasp lay white turf
and cold spray rockbeat surf

and lay rider distort pale
with dew brow rust mail
and tent silent banner alon
the lanc unlift trumpet unblown

and widow ashur loud wail
and idol broke templ baal
and might gentil unsmot sword
hath melt like snow glanc lord

lord byron

the vision OF belshazzar


the king throne
the satrap throng d hall
A thousand bright lamp shone
oer high festiv
A thousand cup gold
In judah deem d divin
jehovah vessel hold
the godless heathen wine

In hour hall
the finger hand
came forth wall
and wrote sand
the finger man
A solitari hand
along letter ran
and trace like wand

the monarch saw shook
and bade rejoic
all bloodless wax d look
and tremul voic
let men lore appear
the wisest earth
and expound word fear
which mar royal mirth

chaldea seer good
but skill
and unknown letter stood
untold aw still
and babel men age
are wise deep lore
but sage
they saw knew

A captiv land
A stranger youth
He heard king command
He saw write truth
the lamp around bright
the propheci view
He read night
the morrow prove true

belshazzar grave made
hi kingdom pass d away
He balanc weigh d
Is light worthless clay
the shroud robe state
hi canopi stone
the mede gate
the persian throne

lord byron




A christma carol


As joseph awalk
He heard angel sing
thi night shall birthtim
Of christ heavenli king

He neither shall born
In housen hall
nor place paradis
but ox stall

He neither shall cloth
In purpl pall
but fair white linen
that usen babi

He neither shall rock
In silver gold
but wooden manger
that resteth mould

As joseph awalk
there angel sing
and mari child midnight
wa born king

then ye glad good peopl
thi night year
and light ye candl
for star shineth clear




ON the morn OF christ S nativ


thi month happi morn
wherein son heav n etern king
Of wed maid virgin mother born

that He deadli forfeit releas
and hi father work us perpetu peac

that gloriou form light unsuffer
and farbeam blaze majesti
wherewith He wont heav n high councilt
To sit midst trinal uniti
He laid asid us
forsook court everlast day
and chose us darksom hous mortal clay

say heavnli muse shall thi sacr vein

To welcom him hi new abod
now heav n sun team untrod

and spangl host keep watch squadron bright

see far upon eastern road
the starl wizard hast odor sweet
O run prevent thi humbl ode
and lay lowli hi bless feet
have thou honor first thi lord greet
and join thi voic unto angel quir
from hi secret altar touch d hallow d fire


the hymn

It winter wild
while heav nborn child

To hide guilti front innoc snow

with turtl wing amor cloud divid
and wave wide myrtl wand

No war battl sound
wa heard world around
the idl spear shield high hung
the hook chariot stood
unstain d hostil blood
the trumpet spake arm throng
and king sat still aw eye
As sure knew sovreign lord

but peac night
wherein princ light
hi reign peac upon earth began
the wind wonder whist
smoothli water kist
whisper new joy mild ocean
who hath quit forgot rave
while bird calm sit brood charm wave

the star deep amaz
stand fix d steadfast gaze
bend one way preciou influenc
and take flight
for morn light
Or lucif often warn d thenc
but glimmer orb glow
until lord himself bespak bid go

and though shadi gloom
had given day room
the sun withheld wont speed
and hid head shame
As inferior flame
the newenlighten d world need
He saw greater sun appear
than bright throne burn axletre could bear

the shepherd lawn
Or ere point dawn
sate simpli chat rustic row
full littl thought
that mighti pan
wa kindli come live
perhap love els sheep
wa silli thought busi keep

when music sweet
their heart ear greet
As never mortal finger strook

As soul bliss raptur took
the air pleasur loth lose
with thousand echo still prolong heavenli close

natur heard sound
beneath hollow round
Of cynthia seat airi region thrill

To think part done
and reign last fulfil
she knew harmoni alon
could hold heav n earth happier union

At last surround sight
A globe circular light
that long beam shamefac d night array d
the helm cherubim
and sword seraphim
are seen glitter rank wing display d
harp loud solemn quir
with unexpress note heaven newborn heir

such music t said
befor never made
but old son morn sung
while creator great
hi constel set
and wellbalanc d world hing hung
and cast dark foundat deep
and bid weltr wave oozi channel keep

ring ye crystal sphere
onc bless human ear
If ye power touch sens
and let silver chime

and let bass heav n deep organ blow
and ninefold harmoni

for holi song

and speckl vaniti

and leprou sin melt earthli mould
and hell pass away
and leav dolor mansion peer day

yea truth justic

with radiant feet tissu cloud steer
and heav n festiv
will open wide gate high palac hall

but wisest fate say No
thi must yet
the babe yet lie smile infanc
that bitter cross

So us glorifi
yet first ychain d sleep
the wake trump doom must thunder deep

with horrid clang
As mount sinai rang
while red fire smoulder cloud outbrak
the age earth aghast
with terror blast
shall surfac centr shake
when world last session
the dread judg middl air shall spread throne

and last bliss

In straiter limit bound

and wroth see kingdom fail

the burn babe


As hoari winter night stood shiver snow
surpris sudden heat made heart glow
and lift fear eye view fire near
A pretti babe burn bright air appear
who scorch excess heat flood tear shed
As though flood quench flame
tear fed
ala quoth He newli born fieri heat fri
yet none approach warm heart feel fire
My faultless breast furnac fuel wound thorn
love fire sigh smoke ash shame scorn
the fuel justic layeth merci blow coal
the metal furnac wrought men defil soul
for fire work good
So melt bath wash blood
with He vanish d sight swiftli shrunk away
and straight call unto mind christmasday

song OF the emigr IN bermuda


where remot bermuda ride
In ocean bosom unespi
from small boat row d along
the listen wind receiv song
what sing hi prais
that led us wateri maze
where He huge seamonst wrack
that lift deep upon back
unto isl long unknown
and yet far kinder
He land us grassi stage
safe storm prelat rage
He gave us etern spring
which enamel everyth
and send fowl us care
On daili visit air
He hang shade orang bright
like golden lamp green night
and pomegran close
jewel rich ormu show
He make fig mouth meet
and throw melon feet
but appl plant price
No tree could ever bear twice
with cedar chosen hand
from lebanon store land
and make hollow sea roar
proclaim ambergri shore
He cast rather boast
the gospel pearl upon coast
and rock us frame
A templ sound hi name
O let voic hi prais exalt
till arriv heaven vault
which perhap rebound may
echo beyond mexiqu bay
thu sung english boat
A holi cheer note
and way guid chime
with fall oar kept time

land OF the pilgrim father IN new england


the break wave dash d high
On stern rockbound coast
and wood stormi sky
their giant branch toss d

and heavi night hung dark
the hill water oer
when band exil moor d bark
On wild new england shore

not conqueror come
they trueheart came
not roll stir drum
and trumpet sing fame

not fli come
In silenc fear
they shook depth desert gloom
with hymn lofti cheer

amidst storm sang
and star heard sea
and sound aisl dim wood rang
To anthem free

the ocean eagl soar d
from nest white wave foam
and rock pine forest roar d
thi welcom home

there men hoari hair
amidst pilgrim band
whi they come wither
away childhood land

there woman fearless eye
lit deep love truth
there manhood brow seren high
and fieri heart youth

what sought thu afar
bright jewel mine
the wealth sea spoil war
they sought faith pure shrine

Ay call holi ground
the soil first trod
they left unstain d found

A song OF prais


To god ye choir begin
A hymn loud strong
that univers may hear
and join grate song

prais him thou sun who dwell unseen
amidst transcend light
where thi refulg orb would seem
A spot dark night

thou silver moon ye host star
the univers song
through seren silent night
To listen world prolong

sing him ye distant world sun
from whenc travel ray
hath yet us age past
had time make way

assist ye rage storm bear
On rapid wing hi prais
from north south east west
through heaven earth sea

exert voic ye furiou fire
that rend wateri cloud
and thunder nether world
your maker word aloud

Ye work god dwell unknown
beneath roll main
Ye bird sing among grove
and sweep azur plain

Ye state hill rear head
and tower pierc sky
Ye cloud aw pace
majest roll high

Ye insect small one leaf
within narrow side
A vast extend world display
and spaciou realm provid

Ye race still less
the stagnant water teem
To one drop howev small
A boundless ocean seem

whate ye where ye dwell
Ye creatur great small
ador wisdom prais power
that made govern

P skelton

made everi region pleas
the hoari alpin hill warm d
and smooth tyrrhen sea

how affright eye
thou sawst wideextend deep
In horror rise

confus dwelt everi face
and fear everi heart
when wave wave gulf gulf

yet grief O lord

whilst confid prayer
My soul took hold thee

for though dread whirl hung
high broken wave
knew thou wert slow hear
nor impot save

At thi command still

true great


the fairest action human life
Is scorn reveng injuri
for forgiv without strife
hi adversari heart doth tie
and t firmer conquest truli said
To win heart overthrow head

If worthi enemi find
To yield worth must nobli done
but baser metal mind
In base reveng honor
who would worthi courag overthrow
and would wrestl worthless foe

We say heart great yield
becaus yield prove poor
great heart task d beyond power seld
the weakest lion loudest roar
truth school certain allow
highhearted doth sometim teach bow

charact OF A happi life


how happi born taught
that serveth anoth
whose armor honest thought
and simpl truth utmost skill

whose passion master
whose soul still prepar death
not tie unto world care
Of public fame privat breath

who envi none chanc doth rais
Or vice never understood
how deepest wound given prais
nor rule state rule good

who hath life rumor freed
whose conscienc strong retreat
whose state neither flatter feed
nor ruin make accus great

who god doth late earli pray
more hi grace gift lend
and entertain harmless day
with wellchosen book friend

thi man freed servil band
Of hope rise fear fall

A thanksgiv TO god for hi hous

A littl hous whose humbl roof

Of harmless thought watch keep

and kitchen small
A littl butteri therein
A littl bin
which keep littl loaf bread
unchipt unflead

Of watercress
which thi kind thou hast sent
and content

To sweet
T thou crownst glitter hearth
with guiltless mirth
and givst wassailbowl drink

lord t thi plentydrop hand
that soil land
and givst bushel sown
twice ten one

all better thou dost send

A thank heart

It glow glitter cloudi breast

Or faint beam hill drest

My day best dull hoari

O holi hope high humil

what mysteri lie beyond thi dust
could man outlook mark

He hath found fledg bird nest may know
At first sight bird flown
but fair dell grove sing

and yet angel brighter dream
call soul man doth sleep
So strang thought transcend wont theme
