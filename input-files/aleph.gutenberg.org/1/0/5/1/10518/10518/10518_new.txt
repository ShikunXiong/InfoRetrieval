A keerless man talk jim

but never flunk never lie

A thousand time swore
He d hold nozzl agin bank
till last soul got ashor

all boat day mississip
and day come last
the movastar better boat
but bell would nt pass
and come tearin along night
the oldest craft line
with nigger squat safetyvalv
and furnac cram rosin pine

the fire bust clare bar
and burnt hole night
and quick flash turn made
for willerbank right
there runnin cursin jim yell
over infern roar
ll hold nozzl agin bank
till last galoot ashor

through hot black breath burnin boat
jim bludso voic heard
and trust cussed
and know would keep word
and sure re born got
afor smokestack fell
and bludso ghost went alon
In smoke prairi bell

He nt saint jedgment

that would nt shook hand
He seen duti deadsur thing
and went thar
and christ ai nt go hard
On man die men



littl breech


nt go much religion
never ai nt show
but ve got middlin tight grip sir
On hand thing know
nt pan prophet
and freewil sort thing
but bliev god angel
ever senc one night last spring

come town turnip
and littl gabe come along
No fouryearold counti
could beat pretti strong
peart chipper sassi
alway readi swear fight
and d larnt chaw terback
jest keep milkteeth white

the snow come like blanket
As pass taggart store
went jug molass
and left team door
they scare someth start
heard one littl squall
and helltosplit prairi
went team littl breech

helltosplit prairi
almost froze skeer
but roust torch
and sarch em far near
At last struck hoss wagon
snow soft white mound
upsot dead beat littl gabe
No hide hair found

and hope sour
Of fellowcritt aid
jest flop marrowbon
crotchdeep snow pray



By torch play
and isrul parr
went wood sheepfold
that said somewhar thar

We found last littl shed
where shut lamb night
We look seen huddl thar
So warm sleepi white
and thar sot littl breech chirp
As peart ever see
want chaw terback
and matter

how git thar angel
He could never walk storm
they jest scoop tote
To whar safe warm
and think save littl child
and fotch
Is dern sight better busi
than loaf around the throne



banti tim

remark sergeant tilmon joy the white man committe spunki

and brile blister burn
how rebel bullet whizz round us
when cuss deathgrip turn
till along toward dusk seen thing

through fireproof giltedg hell

So gentl gazel thar answer
and stay banti tim
He trump death ace day
and m goin back

but ef one tetch boy
He ll wrastl hash tonight hell
Or name tilmon joy

sunris place de la concord

pari august


stand break day
In champ elyse
the tremul shaft dawn
As shoot oer tuileri earli
strike luxor cold gray spire
and wild light morn
with marbl mane fire
ramp white hors marli

but place concord lie
dead hush neath ashi sky
and citi sit council
with sleep wide stone eye
see mystic plain
where armi spectr slain
In emperor lifelong war
march unsound tread
To trumpet whose voic dead
their spectral chief still lead
the ghostli flash sword
like comet mist shine far
and noiseless host pour
for gendarm never heed
Up long dim road thunder
the armi itali onward
through great pale arch star

the spectr armi fade
far glimmer hill
but vagu linger still
A group shudder shade
infect pallid air
grow dimmer day invad
the hush duski squar
there one seem king
As ghost crown
still shadow jailbleach hair
hear guillotin ring
As regicid note rang
when laid tire life
and grew brave last despair
and woman frail fair
who weep leav world
Of love revel sin
In vast unknown hurl
for life wick sweet
with king small white feet
and one everi inch queen
In life death queen
whose blood baptiz place
In day mad fear
her shade never peer
In majesti grace

murder murder swarm
slayer slew slain
till drench place smoke rain
that pour torrent warm
till red rider edom
were splash white garment freedom
with wash horribl storm

and liberti hand clean
In day pride unchain
her royal hand stain
with life king queen
and darker blood
Of nameless brave good
whose blood wit cling
more damn queen king

ha paid dearli
chain watch chosen nation
grind late earli
In mill usurp
have holi tear
flow shame year
wash stain tortur hand
We thought god fresh breez
blow sleep land
In fortyeight wake world
and burgherk hurl
from palac behind tree

As freedom eye aglow
smile glad childbirth pain
how mother know
that woe travail vain
A smirk servant smile
when gave child keep
did know would strangl child
As lay arm asleep

liberti cruellest shame
she stun speechless yet
In grief bloodi sweat
shall make trust blame
the treasur fortyeight
A lurk jailbird stole
she watch wait
As swift sure season roll

and god good hour
come time brave true
freedom shall rise
with blaze aw eye
that shall wither robberpow
As sun dri dew
thi place shall roar voic
Of glad triumphant peopl
and heaven gay chime
ring jubil nois
from everi clamor steepl
the come better time
and dawn freedom wake
shall fling splendor far
like day break
On great pale arch star
and back oer town shall fli
while joybel wild ring
To crown glori spring
from column juli



the sphinx tuileri


out latin quarter
came lofti door
where two marbl sphinx guard
the pavilion de flore
two cockney stood gate one
observ turn go
No wonder He like sort thing
He sphinx know

thought walk garden glow
In sunset level fire
Of charlatan frenchmen loath
and cockney admir
they call sphinx pleas
and narrowli read
We find truth flunkey prais
the man sphinx inde

for sphinx breast woman
and face debonair
had sleek fals paw lion
that could furtiv seiz tear
So far shoulder took
the beast revers would find
the ignobl form craven cur
wa lay behind

she live give simpl folk
A silli riddl read
and fail drank blood
In cruel raven greed
but last came one knew word
and perish pain shame
thi bastard sphinx lead base life
and end

for oedipuspeopl come fast
with swell feet limp
If shout true name aloud
hi fals foul power gone
afraid fight afraid fli
He cower abject shiver
the peopl come last
god mock forev



the surrend spain




land unconqu pelayo land cid campeador
seagirdl mother men spain name glori power
cradl worldgrasp emperor grave reckless invad
how art thou fallen spain art thou sunk hour




onc thi magnanim son trod victor portal asia
onc pacif wave rush joy thi banner see
for trajan carri battleflush eagl dacia
cort plant thi flag fast uttermost sea



ha thou forgotten day illumin glori honor
when far isl sea thrill tread castil
when everi land heaven fleck shade thi banner
when everi beam sun flash thi conquer steel



then red field slaughter death defeat disast
still flare thi banner aloft tatter free stain
now upstart savoyard thou bendest beg master
how red flush shame mar proud beauti spain




ha red blood run cold boil xenil darro
are high deed sire sung children
On dun hill north hast thou heard ploughboy pizarro
roam young swineherd cort hid tagu wild shore




onc hispania bend low yoke stranger
onc rise fling gyve sea
princel piedmont unwit thou weddest doubt danger
king men learn cost free



the prayer the roman


not done near end
Is work eye desir
not yet fulfil near goal
Is hope worn heart fire
and alban mountain
where blush dawn increas
We see flash beauti feet
Of freedom peac

how long fond dream baffl
novara sad mischanc
the kaiser sword fetterlock
and traitor stab franc
till last came gloriou venic
In storm tempest home
and god madden greedi king
and give peopl rome

lame lion caprera
redshirt lost campaign
not idli shed costli blood
you pour gener vein
for shame aspromont
and stain mentana sod
but forg curs king sprang
from break heart god

We lift soul thee O lord
Of liberti light
let earth king pollut work
that done despit
let thi light darken
In shade sordid crown
nor pamper swine devour fruit
thou shookst earthquak

let peopl come birthright
and crosier crown pass away
like phantasm flit oer marsh
At glanc clean white day
and lava aetna
To ice alp let
one freedom one faith without fetter
one republ itali free



the curs hungari


saloman look donjon bar
where danub clamor sedg sand
and curs curs revolt land
with king deep curs treason war

He said may fals land know truth
may good heart die bad one flourish
and greed glori live nourish
envi hate restless youth

In barren soil may ploughshar rust
while sword grow bright fatal labor
and blacken man neighbor
the peril cloud vagu distrust

Be nobl idl peasant thrall
and unknown thing
that link hatr pride king
may forg firm fetter

may king wrong wrong king
may wring heart wrung mine
till pour blood revel like wine
and women monk birthright fling

the mad king die rush river
still brawl spot donjon stand
and swift wave sigh consciou sand
that curs king saloman work forev

for flow pressbourg heard cheer
ring leal cheat heart
that caught chain theresa art
A man cool head girl hot tear

and star scarc risen saw declin
where orsova hill look coldli
As kossuth buri iron crown
and fled dark turkish line

and latest saw summer glare
the magyar nobl pomp array
To shout saw unflesh blade
A hapsburg beat harmless air

but ever sad play saw
the weak worship sword crown
the nobl crush humbl
and mould wrong monstrou law

the donjon stand turbid river
but time crumbl batter tower
and slow light wither despot power
and mad king curs forev



the monk basl


tore weed rank dark soil
where grew monkish time
trim close set
In border modern rhyme




long year ago devil loos
and faith sore tri
three monk basl went walk
In quiet eventid

A breez pure breath heaven
blew fresh cloistershad
A sky glad smile heaven
blush rose oer minsterglad

but scorn lure summer sens
the monk pass walk
their eye abas sens slept
their soul talk

In tough grim talk monkish day
they hammer slash
dri husk logic old scrap creed
and cold gray dream doubt

and whether just justifi
wa church mystic head
and whether bread chang god
Or god becam bread

but human heart outsid wall
they never paus dream
and never thought love god
that smile twilight gleam



As three monk went bicker
By foot spread tree
out heart verdur gloom
A song burst wild free

A wordless carol life love
Of natur free wild
and three monk paus even shade
look smile

and tender gay bird sang
and coo whistl trill
and wast wealth life love
from happi heart spill

the song power grim old monk
In light rosi sky
and listen year roll back
and tear came eye

the year roll back young
with heart hope men
they pluck daisi kiss girl
Of dear dead summer




but eldest monk soon broke spell
T sin shame quoth
To turn talk holi thing
By bird cri tree

perchanc enemi soul
hath come tempt us
let us tri power aw word
If

To heaven three monk rais hand
We charg thee speak said
By hi dread name shall one day come
To judg quick dead

who art thou speak the bird laugh loud
devil said
the monk face fell bird
away twilight sped

A horror fell holi men
the faith legend say
and one one face earth
they pine vanish away




So goe tale monkish book
the moral run may read
He ear natur voic
whose soul slave creed

not vain beauti love
ha god world adorn
and natur scorn mock
By natur mock scorn



the enchant shirt


fytt first wherein shall shown truth mighti
drug feebl temper


the king sick hi cheek red
and eye clear bright
He ate drank kingli zest
and peac snore night

but said sick king know
and doctor came score

At last two famou doctor came
and one poor rat
He pass life studiou toil
and never found time grow fat

the never look book
hi patient gave troubl
If recov paid well
If die heir paid doubl

togeth look royal tongu
As king couch reclin
In success thump august chest
but trace diseas could find

the old sage said you re sound nut
hang roar king gale
In tenknot gale royal rage
the leech grew shade pale

but pensiv rub sagaci nose
and thu prescript ran
king well sleep one night
In shirt happi man


fytt second tell search shirt nigh
found reason said sung

wide oer realm courier rode
and fast hors ran
and mani saw mani spoke
but found happi man

they found poor men would fain rich
and rich thought poor
and men twist waist stay
and women shorthos wore

they saw two men roadsid sit
and bemoan lot
for one buri wife said
and one

At last came villag gate
A beggar lay whistl
He whistl sang laugh roll
On grass soft june air

the weari courier paus look
At scamp blith gay
and one said heaven save friend
you seem happi today

O ye fair sir rascal laugh
and voic rang free glad
An idl man much
that never time sad

thi man courier said
our luck led us aright
give hundr ducat friend
for loan shirt tonight

the merri blackguard lay back grass
and laugh till face black
would god wot roar fun
but nt shirt back


fytt third shew hi majesti king came last sleep
happi man shirt

Of unsuccess spi
and sad panorama human woe

and grew asham useless life
and maladi hatch gloom

and like wound bird pinion trail
she flutter back brokenheart wail

she sob found summer sea
reclin head upon maiden knee
she curl hair kiss woe

she wept now let punish begin
fond foolish let
To expiat sorrow sin

the angel answer nay sad soul go higher
To deceiv true heart desir
wa bitter thousand year fire



On pitz languard


stood top pitz languard
and heard three voic whisper low
where alpin bird circl ward
made swift dark shadow upon snow

she gave kiss sting stain
My broken life rosi dye


second voice

love woman love well tri
and swear believ love still

and never divin one love
one marri though ca nt tell
Of four stori count three


the three weird voic whisper low
where eagl swept circl ward
but one shadow scar snow
As clamber pitz languard



boudoir propheci


one day tuileri
when southwest spanish breez
brought scandal news queen
the fair proud empress said
My good friend lose head
If matter go way

In boulevard de capucin

the say swiftli went
To place orient
and stout queen sneer Ah well

but think hazard guess

with cure carabanchel

both ladi though overwis
were lucki propheci
for boulevard shopmen well
know form stout isabel
As buy mode de pari
and sedan despair
the empress prude fair
went visit madam sa mere
In villa carabanchel
but queen see



A triumph order


A squad regular infantri
In commun close day
had captur crowd rebel
By wall perelachais

there desper men wild women
and darkey amazon girl
and one littl boy peachdown cheek
and yellow cluster curl

the captain seiz littl waif
and said what dost thou
sapristi citizen captain
m communist dear

veri well then die other
veri well that affair
but first let take mother
who live wineshop

My father watch you see
A gay old thing
It would pleas old ladi
then ll come back shot

that last shall see
the grizzl captain grin
As littl man skim hill
like swallow wind

for joy kill lost zest
In glut aw day
and death writh gorg like greedi snake
from arch perelachais

but last platoon fire
the child shrill voic heard
houpla old girl made row
fear break word

against bulletpit wall
He took place rest
A button lost rag blous
which show soft white breast

now blaze away children
with littl onetwothre
the chassepot tore stout young heart
and save societi

No sweeter heart falser

ll sing song true love
My lilith dear

the happiest lover

and happiest

one summer night wander
within lone glade
and couch moss moonlight
He found sleep maid

the star midnight sift
abov sand gold
she seem slumber statu
So fair white cold

fair white cold lay
beneath starri sky
rosi wake
beneath ritter eye

He drowsi fanci
He bore tower
and swift love laughter
flew morn purpl hour

but thicken sunbeam
had drunk gleam dew
A misti cloud sorrow
swept oer eye deep blue

she hung upon ritter neck
S wept love pain
she shower sweet warm kiss
like fragrant summer rain

christian soul sob
As arm lay
m half day woman
A serpent half day

and yonder belltow
ring noonday chime
farewel farewel forev
sir ernst edelsheim

Ah farewel forev
the ritter wildli cri
save lost thee
My love wilibrid

loud lordli belltow
rang noon day
and bower rose
A serpent slid away

but midwatch moonlight
wa shimmer grove
He clasp bride thrice dower
with beauti love

the happiest lover
wa ernst edelsheim
hi true love serpent
onli half time



My castl spain


there never castl seen
So fair mine spain
It stand embow green
crown gentl slope
Of hill xenil shore
and eve shade flaunt oer
the stori vega plain
and tower hid mist hope
and toil year pain
it glimmer gate gain

In vision wild sweet
sometim court greet
sometim joy shine hall
tread favor feet
but never eye light day
were blest ivi wall
where marbl white granit gray
turn gold alik sunbeam play
when soft day dimli fall

know duski room
are treasur rich rare
the spoil eastern loom
and whatev bright fair
painter divin caught
from vault itali air
white god phidian stone
peopl haunt gloom
and song immort singer
like fragrant memori linger
know echo room

but noth soul
nor castl treasur sky
nor wave river roll
with cadenc faint sweet

Of sinai thunder bore trace
and wise elia eye
the shade israel propheci

No mortal eye could bear sight
and look behold
the fieri cloud backward roll
and born aloft grandeur lone

We see christ stand

By savag world could move

and love lord tabor hill

So creed perplex mind
and wrangl load weari wind
when air fill word
and text ring like clash sword

In everi vein hot blood burn

and sturdili back march death
Of terribl pain shame

when deathstricken victim lay sob
At feet slayer priest

To sound cymbal drum
On step high teocal
when delic greek feast

when nile egypt worship lay
and afar rosi flush air

Or kiss absolut rod

By use strength
By wrestl soul sinew

there light fargleam heaven
that never shine eye
To mortal may given
To rang inviol sky

that tempt dread secret shall fail
but strive night till morn
and mightili shalt thou prevail

A greet welcom comer

and far like wave morn pour
her call airi rippl break
and wander farthest shore
her children drowsi heart awak

the wild vibrat float along
oer heartstr tens magic pli
and wake everi breast song
Of love gratitud undi

My heart meet summon leap
At limit strain tether
where fresh western sunlight steep
In golden flame prairi heather

and other happier rise fare
To pass within hallow portal
and see glori shine
shrine steadfast eye immort

what though eye dim dull
their head white reverend blossom
our mother smile beauti
As bore bosom

her heavenli forehead bear line
Of time iconoclast finger
but oer form grace divin
Of deathless youth wisdom linger

We fade pass grow faint old
till youth joy hope banish
and still beauti seem fold
the sum glori vanish

As tithonu falter
the threshold olympian dawn
aurora front etern shone
with lustr myriad morn

So joy slip like dead leav
and hope burnt die ash
rise restless grave crown
our mother brow fadeless flash

and live wrap tradit mist
these honor hall today haunt
and lip lip long wither kiss
the saga past chant

scorn absenc enviou bar
brown smile upon mystic meet
Of son sunder far
In brotherhood heart greet

her wayward children wander
where set star lowli burn
but still worship toward dawn
that gild soul dear mecca turn

Or arm god fight

Or bear banner starri light

she gain crown gem flame
when kneass fell dead victori gori
new splendor blaze upon name
when ive young life went glori

her fire toler freedom burn
till war red eye charm sleep
and bell ring home boy return

and may shed radiant truth
In largess ingenu comer
and hold bloom graciou youth
through mani hundr tranquil summer

after hein countess jutta

from german heinrich hein


the countess jutta pass rhine
In light cano moon pale shine

seest thou water break
seven corps swim
In moonlight dim
So sorrow swim dead

they seven knight full fire youth
they sank heart swore truth
trust truth sweet sake
lest tempt oath break

So sorrow swim dead

the merri countess laugh outright
It rang wild startl night
Up waist dead men rise
and stretch lean finger sky
they nod stare
with glassi glare
So sorrow swim dead

O gloriou ruin O blith undo
O drunk deathtriumph babylon

Of faith last give way

whenc thou comest thou art

and young slave said My name

A crown memori calm brow

A funer vase await tear shower
