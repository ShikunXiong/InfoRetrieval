madr mia

peopl may say thou art longer young
and yet thi youth yesterday
A yesterday seem
still mingl dream
Ah year oer thee flung
their soft mantilla grey

and een thou art old
how couldst thou thi hair
hast scarc lost deep old gloriou dark
thi face scarc line No mark
destroy calm seren like gold
Of even light wind scarc stir
the soullight thi face pure prayer
