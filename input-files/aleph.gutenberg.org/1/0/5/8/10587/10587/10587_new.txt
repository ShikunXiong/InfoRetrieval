TO MR dryden

how long great poet shall thi sacr lay
provok wonder transcend prais
can neither injuri time age
damp thi poetic heat quench thi rage
not thi ovid exil wrote
grief chill breast check rise thought
pensiv sad droop muse betray
the roman geniu last decay
prevail warmth still thi mind possess d
and second youth kindl thi breast

thou makst beauti roman known
and england boast rich
thi line heighten virgil majesti
and horac wonder thee
thou teachest persiu inform isl
In smoother number clearer style
and juven instruct thi page

how thi laurel first began grow
how wild lycaon chang angri god
and fright ran howl wood
Oh mayst thou still nobl task prolong
nor age sick interrupt thi song
then may wonder read human limb

Of rich fruit fertil mould
turn yellow degre ripen gold
how feather rag hide
have live second life differ natur tri
then thi ovid thu transform reveal

TO the right honour sir john somer

Of town unstorm battl yet come

On lord anxiou fear wait

TO the king

when busi field oer
the trumpet sleep cannon ceas roar
when everi dismal echo decay d
and thunder battl laid
attend auspici princ let muse
In humbl accent milder thought infus
other bold prophet number skill d
set thee arm led thee field
My muse expect british strand
wait thi return welcom thee land

she oft seen thee press foe
when europ concern everi blow
but durst heroic strain rejoic
the trumpet drum cannon drown voic
she saw boyn run thick human gore
and float corp lie beat shore
she saw thee climb bank tri vain
To trace hero dusti plain
when thick embattl line broke
now plung amidst foe lost cloud smoke

Oh muse renown lofti vers
In dare number would thi toil rehears
draw thee belov peac fear war
inur noonday sweat midnight care
but still godlik man hard fate
receiv glori toil late
too late vers mighti act succe
one age hero one poet breed
A thousand year full success ran
ere virgil rais voic sung man

who driven stress fate danger bore
On stormi sea disastr shore
befor settl promis earth
and gave empir world birth
troy long found grecian bold fierc
ere homer muster troop vers
long achil quell trojan lust
and laid labour god dust
befor tower muse began flight
and drew hero rage fight

engag tent field roll flood
Or slaughter mortal match god
and perhap fate uner doom
some mighti bard lie hid year come
that shall william godlik act engag
and battl warm futur age
hibernian field shall thi conquest show
and boyn sung ceas flow
here gallic labour shall advanc thi fame
and seneff shall wear anoth name

our late poster secret dread
shall view thi battl pleasur read
how bloodi field near advanc
the guiltless bullet thi shoulder glanc
the race nassau heaven design d
To curb proud oppressor mankind
To bind tyrant earth law
and fight everi injur nation caus
the world great patriot justic call
and favour kingdom rise fall

our british youth unus rough alarm
careless fame neglig arm
had long forgot medit foe
and heard unwarm martial trumpet blow
but inspir thee fresh delight
their sword brandish requir fight
renew ancient conquest main
and act father triumph oer
fire hear agincourt strow d
with gallic corp cressi swam blood

with eager warmth fight ambiti
who first shall storm breach mount wall
In vain throng enemi forc
would clear rampart repel cours
they break william lead way
where fire rage loudest engin play
namur late terror destruct show
what william warm reveng
where thousand turret rais high
their gild spire glitter sky

An undistinguish heap dust found
and pile lie smoke ground
hi toil ignobl end design d
promot common welfar mankind
No wild ambit move europ fear
the cri orphan widow tear
oppress religion give first alarm
and injur justic set arm
hi conquest freedom world afford
and nation bless labour sword

thu form muse would copi forth
A perfect pattern heroic worth
she set man triumphant field
oer giant cloven monster kill d
reek blood smear dust sweat
whilst angri god conspir make great
thi navi ride sea unpress d
and strike terror haughti east
algier tuni sultri shore
with horror hear british engin roar

fain neighbour danger would run
and wish still nearer sun
the gallic ship port confin
deni common use sea wind
nor dare british strength engag
still rememb destruct rage
which late made trembl host retir
stun nois wrapt smoke fire
the wave wide unnumb wreck strow d
and plank arm men promiscu flow d

spain numer fleet perish coast
could scarc longer line battl boast
the wind could hardli drive fate
and ocean labour weight
where wave restless error roll
the sea lie open either pole
now may safe use northern gale
and polar circl spread sail
Or deep southern clime secur war
new land explor sail star

fetch uncontrol labour sun
and make product world
At length proud princ ambiti loui ceas
To plagu mankind troubl europ peac
think structur thi pride raze
On town unpeopl field laid wast
think heap corp stream blood
On everi guilti plain purpl flood
thi arm made ceas impiou war
nor wast live intrust thi care

Or milder thought calm thi mind
behold great aveng mankind
see mighti nassau battl ride
and see thi subject gasp side
fain would piou princ refus alarm
fain would check furi arm
but thi cruelti thought engag
the hero kindl becom rage
then countri stolen captiv unrestor
give strength everi blow edg sword

behold resistless forc fall
On town besieg thunder thi wall
ask villeroy villeroy beheld
the town surrend treati seal d
with amaz strength fort
whilst whole power franc stood look
but stop behold berkley stand
and execut injur king command
around thi coast burst bomb pour
On flame citadel fall tower

with hiss stream fire air streak
and hurl destruct round break
the sky long ascend flame bright
and sea reflect quiver light

and would strength second desir

but run british triumph oer
and count flame dispers everi shore

Oh british peer thu court renown
and grace coat great forefath
our arm would triumphantli advanc

what might england hope abroad

when detain home support state
In william stead bear kingdom weight
the scheme gallic polici oerthrow
and blast counsel common foe

and render maria loss light
but stop muse ungrat sound forbear
maria name still wound british ear

each british heart maria still wound
and tear burst unbidden sound
maria still rise mirth destroy

but see length british ship appear

the rise mast advanc sail grow white
and pompou navi float sight

and steed oerturn lay foam ground
So crown laurel where go

AN account OF the greatest english poet

TO MR henri sacheverel april

sinc dearest harri need request
A short account musepossess d
that chaucer day dryden time
have spent nobl rage british rhyme
without prefac writ formal length
To speak undertak want strength
ll tri make sever beauti known
and show vers worth though

long dull forefath slept supin
nor felt raptur tune nine

till chaucer first merri bard aros
and mani stori told rhyme prose
but age rust poet writ
worn languag obscur wit
In vain jest unpolish strain
and tri make reader laugh vain
old spenser next warm poetic rage
In ancient tale amus barbar age
An age yet uncultiv rude
where poet fanci led pursu

through pathless field unfrequ flood
To den dragon enchant wood
but mystic tale pleas yore
can charm understand age
the longspun allegori fulsom grow
while dull moral lie plain
We view wellpleas distanc sight
Of arm palfrey battl field fight
and damsel distress courteou knight
but look near shade decay

and pleas landscap fade away
great cowley mighti geniu wrote
oerrun wit lavish thought
hi turn close reader press
He pleas us pleas us less
one glitter thought sooner strike eye
with silent wonder new wonder rise
As milkyway shine white
oerflow heaven one continu light
that singl star show ray

whilst jointli promot common blaze
pardon great poet dare name
the unnumb beauti thi vers blame
thi fault wit excess
but wit like thine shape pleas
what muse thine equal hint inspir
and fit deepmouth pindar thi lyre
pindar other labour strain
and forc express imit vain
wellpleas thee soar new delight

and play unbound vers take nobler flight
blest man whose spotless life charm lay
employ tune prelat thi prais
blest man shalt ever known
In sprat success labour thi
but milton next high haughti stalk
unfett majest number walk
No vulgar hero muse engag
nor earth wide scene confin hallow rage
see see upward spring tower high

spurn dull provinc mortal
shake heaven etern throne dire alarm
and set almighti thunder arm
whate pen describ see
whilst everi vers array majesti
bold sublim whole attent draw
and seem critic nicer law
how struck terror delight
when angel archangel cope fight
when great messiah outspread banner shine

how chariot rattl line
what sound brazen wheel thunder scare
and stun reader din war
with fear spirit blood retir
To see seraph sunk cloud fire
but eager step henc rise
and view first gay scene paradis
what tongu word raptur express
A vision profus pleasant
Oh poet neer profan pen

To varnish oer guilt faithless men
hi work might deserv applaus
but languag ca nt support caus
while clean current though seren bright
betray bottom odiou sight
but muse softer strain rehears
turn everi line art smooth thi vers
the courtli waller next command thi lay
muse tune thi vers art waller prais
while tender air love dame inspir

soft melt thought propag desir
So long shall waller strain passion move
and sacharissa beauti kindl love
thi vers harmoni bard flatter song
can make vanquish great coward strong
thi vers show even cromwel innoc
and compliment storm bore henc
Oh thi muse come age soon
but seen great nassau british throne
how triumph glitter thi page

and warm thee exalt rage
what scene death horror view d
and boyn wide current reek blood
Or maria charm thou wouldst rehears
In smoother number softer vers
thi pen well describ grace air
and gloriana would seem fair
nor must roscommon pass neglect
that make even rule nobl poetri
rule whose deep sens heavenli number show

the best critic poet
nor denham must eer forget thi strain
while cooper hill command neighbour plain
but see art dryden next appear
grown old rhyme charm even year
great dryden next whose tune muse afford
the sweetest number fittest word
whether comic sound tragic air
she form voic move smile tear
If satir heroic strain write

her hero pleas satir bite
from harsh unart number fall
she wear dress charm
how might fear english poetri
that long flourish decay thee
did muse hope appear
harmoni congrev forbid fear
congrev whose fanci unexhaust store
ha given alreadi much promis
congrev shall still preserv thi fame aliv

and dryden muse shall friend surviv
m tire rhyme would fain give oer
but justic still demand one labour
the nobl montagu remain unnam
for wit humour judgment fame
To dorset direct art muse
In number dorset self might use
how neglig grace unrein
hi vers write loos familiar strain

A letter from itali

TO the right honour charl lord halifax IN the year

salv magna paren frugum saturnia tellu
magna virum tibi re antiqua laudi et arti
aggredior sancto ausu recluder font

while lord rural shade admir
and britannia public post retir
nor longer ungrat son pleas
for advantag sacrific eas
Me foreign realm fate convey
through nation fruit immort lay
where soft season invit clime

for wheresoe turn ravish eye
gay gild scene shine prospect rise

poetic field encompass around
and still seem tread classic ground
for muse oft harp strung
that mountain rear head unsung
renown vers shadi thicket grow
and everi stream heavenli number flow
how pleas search hill wood
for rise spring celebr flood
To view nar tumultu cours
and trace smooth clitumnu sourc

To see mincio draw wateri store
through long wind fruit shore
and hoari albula infect tide
oer warm bed smoke sulphur glide

eridanu floweri meadow stray
the king flood roll oer plain
the tower alp half moistur drain
and proudli swoln whole winter snow

sometim misguid tune throng

that lost silenc oblivion lie

and smooth descript murmur still

and fame river empti shore admir
that destitut strength deriv cours

So high deathless muse exalt theme

Oh could muse ravish breast inspir

and virgil itali yield mine
see golden grove around smile
that shun coast britain stormi isl
Or transplant preserv care

here kindli warmth mount juic ferment
To nobler tast exalt scent

even rough rock tender myrtl bloom
and trodden weed send rich perfum
bear god baia gentl seat
Or cover umbria green retreat
where western gale etern resid
and season lavish pride
blossom fruit flower togeth rise
and whole year gay confus lie

and soul thousand passion strive

when rome exalt beauti descri

An amphitheatr amaz height
here fill eye terror delight
that public show unpeopl rome
and held uncrowd nation womb
here pillar rough sculptur pierc sky
and proud triumphal arch rise
where old roman deathless act display

and wonder height airi channel flow
still new scene wander muse retir
and dumb show breath rock admir
where smooth chisel forc shown

In solemn silenc majest band

while bright dame humbl su

fain would raphael godlik art rehears
and show immort labour vers
where mingl strength shade light
A new creation rise sight

So warm life blend colour glow

how kind heaven adorn happi land

On foreign mountain may sun refin

with citron grove adorn distant soil
and fat oliv swell flood oil
We envi warmer clime lie
In ten degre indulg sky
nor coars heaven repin
though oer head frozen pleiad shine

A nicer touch stretch canva give
Or teach anim rock live

and hold balanc contend state
To threaten bold presumptu king war
and answer afflict neighbour prayer
the dane swede rous fierc alarm

the ambiti gaul behold secret dread
her thunder aim aspir head
and fain godlik son would disunit
By foreign gold domest spite

On barren mountain wast sand

A tediou pleasur mind bestow
and pall sens one continu show
but two magician tri skill
the vision vari though place stand still
while spot gaudi form renew

and could hippolitu repli greek

By old rule must stand fall today

Of polish ivori cover wrought

To suspect father palac went

AN ode



the spaciou firmament high
with blue ether sky
and spangl heaven shine frame
their great origin proclaim
the unweari sun day day
doe creator power display
and publish everi land
the work almighti hand



soon even shade prevail
the moon take wondrou tale
and nightli listen earth
repeat stori birth
whilst star round burn
and planet turn
confirm tide roll
and spread truth pole pole



what though solemn silenc
move round dark terrestri ball
what though real voic sound
amidst radiant orb found
In reason ear rejoic
and utter forth gloriou voic
for ever sing shine
the hand made us divin



AN hymn

O shall word equal warmth
the gratitud declar
that glow within ravish d heart
but thou canst read


thi provid life sustain d
and want redress d
when silent womb lay
and hung upon breast


To weak complaint cri
thi merci lent ear
ere yet feebl thought learnt
To form prayer


unnumb d comfort soul
thi tender care bestow d
befor infant heart conceiv d
from whenc comfort flow d


when slipperi path youth
with heedless step ran
thine arm unseen convey d safe
and led man


through hidden danger toil death
It gentli clear d way
and pleas snare vice
more fear d


when worn sick oft hast thou
with health renew d face
and sin sorrow sunk
reviv d soul grace


thi bounteou hand worldli bliss
ha made cup run oer
and kind faith friend
ha doubl store


ten thousand thousand preciou gift
My daili thank employ
nor least cheer heart
that tast gift joy


through everi period life
thi good ll pursu
and death distant world
the gloriou theme renew


when natur fail day night

My evergr heart O lord

through etern thee
A joy song ll rais
for oh etern short
To utter thi prais



AN ode


how thi servant blest O lord
how sure defenc
etern wisdom guid
their help omnipot


In foreign realm land remot
support thi care
through burn clime pass d unhurt
and breath d taint air


thi merci sweeten d everi soil
made everi region pleas
the hoari alpin hill warm d
and smooth d tyrrhen sea


think O soul devoutli think
how affright eye
thou sawst wideextend deep
In horror rise


confus dwelt everi face
and fear everi heart
when wave wave gulph gulph
oercam pilot art


yet grief O lord
thi merci set free
whilst confid prayer
My soul took hold thee


for though dread whirl hung
high broken wave
knew thou wert slow hear
nor impot save


the storm laid wind retir
obedi thi
the sea roar d thi command
At thi command still


In midst danger fear death
thi good ll ador
and prais thee thi merci past
and humbl hope


My life thou preservst life
thi sacrific shall
and death death must doom
shall join soul thee



AN hymn


when rise bed death
oerwhelm d guilt fear
see maker face face
O shall appear


If yet pardon may found
and merci may sought
My heart inward horror shrink
and trembl thought


when thou O lord shalt stand disclo d
In majesti sever
and sit judgment soul
O shall appear


but thou hast told troubl soul
who sin lament
the time tribut tear
shall endless woe prevent


then see sorrow heart
ere yet late
and add saviour die groan
To give sorrow weight


for never shall soul despair
her pardon procur
who know thi son die
To make pardon sure



paraphras ON psalm xxiii



the lord pastur shall prepar
and feed shepherd care
hi presenc shall want suppli
and guard watch eye
My noonday walk shall attend
and midnight hour defend



when sultri glebe faint
Or thirsti mountain pant
To fertil vale dewi mead
My weari wander step lead
where peac river soft slow
amid verdant landscap flow



though path death tread
with gloomi horror overspread
My steadfast heart shall fear ill
for thou O lord art still
thi friendli crook shall give aid
and guid dread shade



though bare rug way
through deviou lone wild stray
thi bounti shall want beguil
the barren wilder shall smile
with sudden green herbag crown d
and stream shall murmur around

Of moral life drawn school

A virtuou mind moral glean

pride often guid author pen
book affect men
but studi natur law
from certain truth maxim draw
and without school suffic
To make men moral good wise

To exalt station

Oh shall truelov find

If sweet william sail among crew

He sigh d cast eye
the cord slide swiftli glow hand
and quick lightn deck stand



So sweet lark high pois air
shut close pinion breast
If chanc mate shrill call hear
and drop nest
the noblest captain british fleet
might envi william lip kiss sweet



O susan susan love dear
My vow shall ever true remain
let kiss fall tear
We part meet
chang ye list ye wind heart shall
the faith compass still point thee



believ landmen say
who tempt doubt thi constant mind
they ll tell thee sailor away
In everi port mistress find
ye ye believ tell thee
for thou art present wheresoe go



If fair india coast sail
thi eye seen diamond bright
thi breath afric spici gale

wake soul charm love sue



though battl call thi arm
let pretti susan mourn
though cannon roar yet safe harm
william shall dear return
love turn asid ball round fli
lest preciou tear drop susan eye



the boatswain gave dread word
the sail swell bosom spread
No longer must stay aboard
they kiss d sigh d hung head
her lessen boat unwil row land

A ballad

from the what D ye callit



T sea roar
with hollow blast wind
A damsel lay deplor

whi didst thou ventur lover
whi didst thou trust sea
ceas ceas thou cruel ocean
and let lover rest
Ah thi troubl motion
To within breast



the merchant robb d pleasur
see tempest despair

To lose dear
should coast laid
where gold diamond grow
you d find richer maiden
but none love



how say natur
ha noth made vain
whi beneath water
should hideou rock remain
No eye rock discov
that lurk beneath deep
To wreck wander lover
and leav maid weep



all melancholi lie
thu wail d dear
repaid blast sigh
each billow tear
when oer white wave stoop
hi float corps spi
then like lili droop
she bow d head die
